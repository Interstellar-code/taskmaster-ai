# Description: Integrate the PRD Kanban board as a submenu option within the existing Project Management menu structure of TaskMaster's interactive menu system.
# Details:
Modify the Project Management menu definition to include a new option: 'ðŸ“Š PRD Kanban Board'. This option should launch the PRD Kanban board view. Ensure seamless transition between the menu and the Kanban board, and that exiting the Kanban board returns the user to the Project Management menu.

# Test Strategy:
Launch TaskMaster and navigate to the Project Management menu. Verify that the 'ðŸ“Š PRD Kanban Board' option is present. Select the option and confirm the Kanban board loads. Exit the Kanban board and ensure it returns to the Project Management menu.
