# Description: Ensure full integration with the existing `prd/prds.json` metadata structure and status-based directory organization. This includes reading PRD metadata, updating PRD status, and ensuring file organization consistency.
# Details:
Verify that all PRD data is read from and written to `prd/prds.json` using existing TaskMaster utilities (e.g., `readPrdsMetadata`, `updatePrdStatus`). Confirm that PRD status updates trigger the existing logic for organizing PRD files into their respective status-based directories (`pending`, `in-progress`, `done`, `archived`). Ensure no new status values are introduced and that all status changes adhere to existing validation rules.

# Test Strategy:
Perform end-to-end tests involving PRD creation (outside the Kanban board), status updates within the Kanban board, and verification of `prd/prds.json` and file system organization. Introduce external changes to `prd/prds.json` and verify the board reflects them after refresh. Attempt to use invalid status values (if possible) to ensure validation holds.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Verify Read/Write Operations with prd/prds.json using TaskMaster Utilities [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Confirm that all read and write operations for PRD data correctly interact with `prd/prds.json` by leveraging existing TaskMaster utilities. This includes creating, updating, and deleting PRD entries.
### Details:
Ensure that the integration uses established TaskMaster functions for file system interaction to maintain consistency and avoid direct file manipulation. Validate that data written to `prd/prds.json` is correctly formatted and readable, and that data read from it accurately reflects the file's content.

## 2. Confirm PRD Status Update Triggers File System Organization [pending]
### Dependencies: 57.1
### Description: Validate that changes in PRD status (e.g., 'approved', 'in-progress', 'completed') correctly trigger the associated file system organization logic, such as moving PRD documents to different directories or updating metadata.
### Details:
Test various PRD status transitions to ensure that the corresponding file system actions are executed as expected. This includes verifying the correct destination paths for moved files and the accuracy of any updated file metadata or directory structures.

## 3. Validate Adherence to Existing PRD Data Models and Validation Rules [pending]
### Dependencies: 57.1
### Description: Ensure that all PRD data, whether newly created or updated, strictly adheres to the predefined PRD data models and passes all existing validation rules. This prevents data corruption and maintains consistency with historical data.
### Details:
Implement checks to verify that PRD entries conform to the expected schema (e.g., required fields, data types, format). Test edge cases and invalid inputs to confirm that validation rules correctly reject malformed data and provide appropriate error messages.

## 4. Establish Robust Testing Strategy for Data Integrity Across All Operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 57.1, 57.2, 57.3
### Description: Develop and implement a comprehensive testing strategy to ensure data integrity and consistency across all PRD tracking system operations, including read, write, and status-triggered file system changes.
### Details:
This strategy should include unit tests for individual components, integration tests for data flow between modules, and end-to-end tests simulating real-world scenarios. Focus on testing concurrent operations, error handling, and recovery mechanisms to prevent data loss or corruption. Include regression tests to ensure new features do not break existing functionality.
