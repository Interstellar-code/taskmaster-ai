# Description: Develop the functionality for automatically moving PRD files between status-based directories (`/prd/pending`, `/prd/in-progress`, `/prd/done`) while preserving filenames and ensuring atomic operations.
# Details:
Create a module responsible for moving PRD files. This module should be triggered by PRD status changes. Implement atomic file operations (e.g., copy then delete, or rename) to prevent data loss. Ensure original filenames are preserved. Implement a backup mechanism before any file movement occurs.

# Test Strategy:
Change PRD statuses to trigger file moves. Verify that the PRD file is moved to the correct directory and its `filePath` in `prds.json` is updated. Confirm original filenames are maintained and no data loss occurs during moves. Test backup creation.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Automated PRD File Movement Module [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a high-level design document for the automated PRD file movement module, outlining its architecture, components, interfaces, and overall workflow. This includes defining input/output specifications and error handling strategies.
### Details:
Focus on modularity and extensibility. Consider using a state machine for file processing.

## 2. Implement Atomic File Operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 43.1
### Description: Develop and integrate functions for atomic file operations (e.g., move, copy, delete) to ensure data integrity during file transfers. This involves using temporary files and renaming for 'move' operations to prevent partial file states.
### Details:
Utilize OS-level atomic operations where available. Implement robust error handling and rollback mechanisms.

## 3. Preserve Filename and Path Integrity [pending]
### Dependencies: 43.2
### Description: Ensure that original filenames and relative path structures are preserved during the automated movement process. This includes handling special characters and long path names.
### Details:
Implement robust path manipulation and validation logic. Test with various filename conventions.

## 4. Develop Robust Backup Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 43.1
### Description: Design and implement a comprehensive backup mechanism for PRD files before they are moved. This should include configurable backup locations, retention policies, and verification of backup integrity.
### Details:
Consider incremental vs. full backups. Implement checksum verification for backed-up files.

## 5. Integrate File Movement with Backup System [pending]
### Dependencies: 43.3, 43.4
### Description: Combine the atomic file movement logic with the robust backup mechanism, ensuring that a successful backup occurs before any file movement is attempted, and that rollback is possible in case of failure.
### Details:
Implement a transaction-like approach where backup is the first step, followed by movement. Define clear rollback procedures.

## 6. Implement Monitoring and Logging [pending]
### Dependencies: 43.5
### Description: Develop comprehensive logging for all file movement and backup operations, including success/failure status, timestamps, and detailed error messages. Implement monitoring alerts for critical failures.
### Details:
Use a structured logging framework. Integrate with existing monitoring systems if applicable.
