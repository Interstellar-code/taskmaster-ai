# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Robust Error Handling and Input Validation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement robust error handling mechanisms for user input validation and command execution failures, ensuring graceful recovery and clear feedback to the user.
# Details:
Integrate input validation for all menu selections and command parameters using `inquirer.js` validation features. Provide clear, actionable error messages for invalid input. Implement `try-catch` blocks or similar mechanisms around command executions to gracefully handle failures. Ensure that after an error, the user is returned to the relevant menu with options for recovery. Log errors for debugging purposes.

# Test Strategy:
Intentionally provide invalid input at various menu prompts and command parameter prompts, verifying correct error messages and graceful recovery. Simulate command failures and ensure the menu system handles them without crashing, returning to the menu as expected.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Integrate Inquirer.js Input Validation for Menu Selections [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement robust input validation for all menu selections using Inquirer.js's built-in validation features. This includes ensuring that user input for menu choices corresponds to valid options.
### Details:
For each Inquirer.js prompt used for menu selections (e.g., list, rawlist, expand), add a `validate` function. This function should check if the user's input is one of the expected options. Provide clear, user-friendly error messages for invalid selections. Consider using a helper function to centralize common validation logic.

## 2. Implement Inquirer.js Input Validation for Command Parameters [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Extend input validation to all command parameters that require user input. This involves validating data types, formats, and constraints for parameters like file paths, names, or numerical values.
### Details:
For each Inquirer.js prompt used to gather command parameters (e.g., input, number), add a `validate` function. This function should enforce specific rules such as non-emptiness, correct data type (e.g., numeric, string), specific format (e.g., valid file path pattern), or range constraints. Provide specific, actionable error messages for each validation failure.

## 3. Implement Centralized Error Logging Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Create a centralized mechanism for logging errors that occur during command execution or input processing. This log should be useful for debugging and post-mortem analysis.
### Details:
Implement a simple logging utility (e.g., using `console.error` or a dedicated logging library like Winston/Pino if scope allows) that can record error details such as timestamp, error type, stack trace, and relevant context (e.g., command executed, input provided). Ensure logs are written to a file or displayed prominently in the console for development. Define a standard error object or structure.

## 4. Integrate Try-Catch for Command Execution and Graceful Recovery [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Wrap all critical command execution logic within `try-catch` blocks or similar error handling constructs to gracefully manage runtime exceptions and failures.
### Details:
Identify all points where external commands are executed or potentially failing operations occur (e.g., file system operations, external API calls). Enclose these operations in `try-catch` blocks. Within the `catch` block, log the error using the mechanism from subtask 3, provide a user-friendly error message to the console, and ensure the application returns to the relevant menu or a stable state, rather than crashing.

## 5. Refine User Feedback and Recovery Flow [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.4
### Description: Ensure that after any error (input validation or command execution), the user receives clear, actionable feedback and is gracefully returned to a relevant menu or prompt for recovery.
### Details:
Review all error paths. For input validation errors, ensure the prompt re-appears with the error message. For command execution errors, after displaying the error message and logging, ensure the control flow returns to the main menu or the specific sub-menu from which the command was initiated, allowing the user to choose another action or retry. Avoid infinite loops or dead ends.
