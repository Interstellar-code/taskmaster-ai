### Details:
Expand on the 'Key Features' and 'Common Workflows' sections. Describe the purpose and usage of each significant feature accessible via the menu. Provide step-by-step examples for typical user scenarios (e.g., 'How to create a new task using the menu', 'How to filter tasks'). Use clear, concise language and avoid jargon where possible.

## 4. Review, Refine, and Add Visuals [done]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Conduct a comprehensive review of all drafted content for clarity, conciseness, accuracy, and consistency. Integrate relevant screenshots or diagrams to enhance understanding.
