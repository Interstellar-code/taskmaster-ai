# Task ID: 28
# Title: Establish Comprehensive Testing Strategy
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27
# Priority: low
# PRD Source: None (manually created)
# Description: Establish a robust testing strategy covering unit, integration, end-to-end, performance, and cross-platform compatibility for all new PRD source tracking features.
# Details:
Develop a detailed test plan encompassing unit tests for individual components (e.g., PRD metadata extraction, hash calculation), integration tests for command interactions and data flow, end-to-end tests for complete user workflows (e.g., parse PRD -> view tasks -> re-parse PRD), performance tests with large datasets, and cross-platform compatibility tests (Windows, macOS, Linux) to address file path handling and other OS-specific nuances. Automate as many tests as possible.

# Test Strategy:
Execution of all defined test cases. Monitoring of test coverage metrics. Documentation of test results and bug reports. Regular review of the test suite to ensure it remains comprehensive and effective as features evolve.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Scope and Features for Testing [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify all new PRD source tracking features that require testing. List specific functionalities, user flows, and data points associated with these features.
### Details:
Review PRD documents, design specifications, and any existing feature breakdowns to create a definitive list of new source tracking features. This will form the basis for all subsequent testing activities.

## 2. Develop Unit Test Plan and Scenarios [done]
### Dependencies: 28.1
### Description: Outline the strategy for unit testing, including key test scenarios for individual components and functions of the new source tracking features.
### Details:
For each identified feature, break down into smallest testable units. Define expected inputs, outputs, and edge cases. Specify mocking strategies for dependencies.

## 3. Develop Integration Test Plan and Scenarios [done]
### Dependencies: 28.1
### Description: Create a plan for integration testing, focusing on interactions between different modules and services related to source tracking.
### Details:
Identify integration points between new source tracking features and existing systems (e.g., database, analytics, UI). Define scenarios for data flow, API calls, and error handling across integrated components.

## 4. Develop End-to-End Test Plan and Scenarios [done]
### Dependencies: 28.1
### Description: Design end-to-end test scenarios that simulate real user journeys involving the new source tracking features from start to finish.
### Details:
Map out complete user flows involving source tracking, from initial input to final data persistence and reporting. Include positive, negative, and boundary test cases covering all user interactions.

## 5. Develop Performance Test Plan and Scenarios [done]
### Dependencies: 28.1
### Description: Outline the strategy for performance testing, including load, stress, and scalability tests for the new source tracking features.
### Details:
Define performance objectives (e.g., response times, throughput, resource utilization). Specify test scenarios for concurrent users, data volume, and sustained load to identify bottlenecks and ensure scalability.

## 6. Develop Cross-Platform Compatibility Test Plan [done]
### Dependencies: 28.1
### Description: Create a plan for testing the new source tracking features across different browsers, operating systems, and devices.
### Details:
Identify target platforms, browsers, and devices. Define test scenarios to ensure consistent functionality, UI rendering, and performance across all specified environments.

## 7. Define Automation Strategy and Test Coverage Metrics [done]
### Dependencies: 28.2, 28.3, 28.4, 28.5, 28.6
### Description: Specify the automation strategy for all test types and define key metrics for measuring test coverage.
### Details:
Determine which test types will be automated (e.g., unit, integration, some E2E, performance). Select automation tools and frameworks. Define metrics such as code coverage, requirement coverage, and defect escape rate.

## 8. Outline Test Suite Review and Maintenance Plan [done]
### Dependencies: 28.7
### Description: Establish a process for regular review, update, and maintenance of the test suites for the new source tracking features.
### Details:
Define frequency for test suite reviews (e.g., sprintly, release-based). Specify criteria for updating test cases, removing obsolete tests, and adding new ones based on feature changes or defect analysis. Assign ownership for maintenance.
