# Description: Implement terminal-based navigation controls and board management features, including filtering, searching, displaying board statistics, showing a help overlay, and exiting the Kanban view. Also, ensure seamless integration with the existing TaskMaster interactive menu system.
# Details:
Implement the following keyboard shortcuts for board navigation and controls: 'F' to toggle filter mode (priority, PRD source, status), '/' to open search mode, 'S' to show board statistics (total tasks, completion %) in the status bar, 'H' to display a help overlay with all keyboard shortcuts, and 'Q' to exit the Kanban view and return to the TaskMaster menu. Implement Tab key functionality to cycle through different board sections (columns, filters, help). Ensure the status bar consistently displays the current mode and available shortcuts. Integrate the Kanban board view as a new option ('ðŸ“Š Kanban Board View') within the existing TaskMaster 'Task Operations' submenu, ensuring a smooth transition into and out of the Kanban interface.

# Test Strategy:
Test each navigation and control shortcut ('F', '/', 'S', 'H', 'Q', Tab). Verify that 'F' toggles filter options, '/' activates search, 'S' displays correct statistics, and 'H' shows the help overlay. Confirm 'Q' exits the Kanban view and returns to the TaskMaster menu. Test Tab key cycling through board sections. Verify that the Kanban board option is correctly integrated into the TaskMaster 'Task Operations' submenu and that selecting it launches the board as expected. Ensure the status bar updates correctly with mode and shortcuts.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement Keyboard Shortcut Listener [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a global keyboard event listener to capture 'F', '/', 'S', 'H', and 'Q' key presses and trigger corresponding actions. This includes mapping keys to specific functions (filter, search, statistics, help, exit).
### Details:
This subtask involves setting up the core mechanism for keyboard navigation. It needs to be robust enough to avoid conflicts with other inputs and handle different states of the application.

## 2. Develop Filter Mode UI and Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 38.1
### Description: Create the user interface for the filter mode, allowing users to apply various filters to the Kanban board. Implement the backend logic to process filter criteria and update the displayed tasks accordingly.
### Details:
This subtask requires designing intuitive filter options (e.g., by assignee, status, due date) and implementing the filtering algorithm. It should integrate with the keyboard shortcut for 'F'.

## 3. Develop Search Mode UI and Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 38.1
### Description: Design and implement the UI for the search mode, enabling users to search for tasks within the Kanban board. Develop the logic to perform efficient searches and highlight/display matching tasks.
### Details:
This subtask involves creating a search input field and implementing a search algorithm (e.g., fuzzy search, keyword matching). It should integrate with the keyboard shortcut for '/'.

## 4. Implement Statistics Display and Help Overlay [done]
### Dependencies: 38.1
### Description: Develop the UI and logic to display board statistics (e.g., task counts per column, completed tasks). Create a help overlay that provides information on keyboard shortcuts and board functionalities.
### Details:
This subtask involves calculating and presenting relevant board metrics. The help overlay should be easily accessible and informative, integrating with 'S' and 'H' keyboard shortcuts respectively.

## 5. Integrate Kanban Board into TaskMaster 'Task Operations' Submenu [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Modify the existing TaskMaster menu structure to include the Kanban board view under the 'Task Operations' submenu. Ensure proper menu navigation and state management when entering and exiting the Kanban interface.
### Details:
This subtask requires understanding the existing menu system and seamlessly embedding the new Kanban view. It involves updating menu configurations and potentially routing logic.

## 6. Ensure Smooth Transitions and Status Bar Updates [done]
### Dependencies: 38.2, 38.3, 38.4, 38.5
### Description: Implement mechanisms to ensure smooth visual and functional transitions when entering and exiting the Kanban interface. Develop logic to update the application's status bar to reflect the current mode or relevant information.
### Details:
This subtask focuses on user experience, ensuring that switching between modes (e.g., filter, search) and entering/exiting the Kanban board is fluid. It also involves updating the status bar to provide contextual feedback to the user.
