# Description: Establish the core directory structure for PRD management, including 'pending', 'in-progress', 'done', 'archived', and 'templates' folders, along with the central 'prds.json' file.
# Details:
Create the `/prd/` root directory. Inside, create subdirectories: `/prd/pending`, `/prd/in-progress`, `/prd/done`, `/prd/archived`, and `/prd/templates`. Initialize an empty `prds.json` file at `/prd/prds.json` with the base metadata structure as defined in the PRD.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that all specified directories are created and `prds.json` exists and is accessible. Check initial content of `prds.json` for correct structure.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Core PRD Directory Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the main 'prd' directory and its immediate subdirectories: 'specs', 'assets', and 'docs'.
### Details:
This involves using `mkdir` or equivalent commands to establish the foundational directory structure for the PRD.

## 2. Initialize Main PRD File [pending]
### Dependencies: 39.1
### Description: Create an empty 'main.md' file within the 'prd' directory.
### Details:
This file will serve as the primary entry point for the Product Requirements Document. Use `touch` or similar to create the empty file.

## 3. Verify PRD Directory Structure and File [pending]
### Dependencies: 39.1, 39.2
### Description: Confirm that all specified directories and the 'main.md' file have been created correctly.
### Details:
This step involves listing the contents of the 'prd' directory and its subdirectories to ensure everything is in place as expected. Use `ls -R prd` or similar commands.
