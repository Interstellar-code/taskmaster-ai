# Description: Integrate PRD filtering and viewing options into the existing Kanban board and add a new 'PRD Management' section to the interactive menu.
# Details:
Modify the Kanban board to include filtering options: 'View All Tasks', 'View Tasks by PRD' (allowing selection of a specific PRD), and 'View Tasks by PRD Status' (filtering by pending/in-progress/done PRDs). Add a new 'ðŸ“„ PRD Management' section to the main interactive menu, providing options to list PRDs, show details, update status, sync, and archive.

# Test Strategy:
Access the Kanban board and verify that the new PRD filtering options are available and function correctly. Navigate through the interactive menu to the new 'PRD Management' section and test each option for correct functionality and display.
