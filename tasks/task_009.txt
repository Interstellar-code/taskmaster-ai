# Task ID: 9
# Title: Comprehensive Testing and Quality Assurance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Conduct comprehensive testing of all menu paths, command integrations, error handling, and performance to ensure stability, usability, and adherence to all requirements.
# Details:
Perform end-to-end testing of all menu navigation paths, including main menu, sub-menus, back, and exit options. Test every command integration, ensuring correct parameter handling, output display, and return to menu. Thoroughly test all error handling scenarios. Verify backward compatibility with existing commands. Conduct cross-platform compatibility testing on major terminal applications. Document any identified bugs and ensure they are addressed.

# Test Strategy:
Execute a comprehensive test suite covering all functional and non-functional requirements. Use a combination of manual and automated tests. Track test coverage and defect rates. Verify all acceptance criteria are met.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Develop Comprehensive Test Plan and Test Cases [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a detailed test plan outlining the scope, objectives, resources, and schedule for comprehensive testing. Develop specific test cases for all menu navigation paths, command integrations, error handling scenarios, and cross-platform compatibility. Prioritize test cases based on criticality and frequency of use.
### Details:
The test plan should cover functional, integration, error handling, and compatibility testing. Test cases should include preconditions, steps, expected results, and post-conditions. Utilize a test management tool if available to organize and track test cases.

## 2. Execute Functional and Navigation Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Execute all test cases related to menu navigation (main menu, sub-menus, back, exit options) and core command functionalities. Verify correct display, input handling, and transitions between different parts of the application.
### Details:
Systematically go through each menu path and command, ensuring that all options are accessible and function as expected. Document any deviations from expected behavior as bugs. Pay close attention to edge cases in navigation.

## 3. Execute Command Integration and Error Handling Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Thoroughly test all command integrations, ensuring correct parameter handling, output display, and proper return to the main menu or previous state. Conduct extensive error handling testing, including invalid inputs, missing parameters, and system errors, to ensure graceful degradation and informative error messages.
### Details:
For command integration, test with valid, invalid, and boundary parameters. Verify that outputs are correctly formatted and displayed. For error handling, simulate various error conditions (e.g., network issues, file not found, permission denied) and confirm that the application handles them robustly without crashing, providing user-friendly feedback.

## 4. Perform Cross-Platform Compatibility and Backward Compatibility Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.3
### Description: Test the application's compatibility across major terminal applications (e.g., Bash, Zsh, PowerShell, CMD) and operating systems (if applicable). Verify backward compatibility with existing commands and configurations to ensure seamless upgrades for existing users.
### Details:
Set up test environments for each target terminal and OS. Execute a subset of critical functional and integration test cases on each platform. For backward compatibility, test the new version with configurations and data generated by previous versions of the application.

## 5. Performance Testing and Bug Resolution Tracking [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.4
### Description: Conduct basic performance tests to identify any significant bottlenecks or slowdowns during typical usage. Document all identified bugs, prioritize them, and track their resolution through to retesting and closure. Generate a final test report summarizing findings.
### Details:
Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory) during heavy command execution or long sessions. Use a bug tracking system to log, assign, and manage defects. Ensure all critical and major bugs are resolved and retested before final sign-off. The test report should include test coverage, executed test cases, defects found, and overall quality assessment.
