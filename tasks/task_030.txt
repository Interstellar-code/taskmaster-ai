# Description: Integrate the automatic task expansion logic into the PRD parsing workflow. When the 'Append + Auto-Expand' option is selected, the system should identify complex tasks suitable for expansion and automatically expand them into subtasks using existing AI models and expansion criteria. Only tasks meeting the defined expansion criteria (complexity, description length, feature scope) should be expanded.
# Details:
Modify the `parse-prd` command's logic to incorporate the auto-expansion step after initial task parsing when the new option is chosen. Reuse the existing task expansion logic and AI models that are currently used by the `expand` command. Implement a mechanism to identify 'complex' tasks based on criteria such as description length, presence of keywords indicating complexity, or predefined feature scope. This identification should precede the expansion process. Ensure that the expansion process maintains all existing functionality and quality standards of the standalone expansion command. Provide progress feedback to the user during this process.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for the integration of expansion logic within the parsing flow. Integration tests with various PRD examples (small, large, mixed complexity) to verify that complex tasks are correctly identified and expanded, while simple tasks are not. Performance testing to ensure the auto-expansion adds no more than 30% to the total parsing time. Verify that the progress feedback is displayed correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Add 'Append + Auto-Expand' Option to PRD Parsing Command [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Modify the `parse-prd` command-line interface (CLI) to include a new option, e.g., `--auto-expand` or `--append-auto-expand`. This option will trigger the auto-expansion logic during PRD parsing.
### Details:
Update the `parse-prd` command's argument parser (e.g., `argparse` in Python) to recognize and store the state of this new option. Ensure it's mutually exclusive or appropriately combined with existing append options if necessary. The option should be a boolean flag.

## 2. Implement Task Complexity Identification Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 30.1
### Description: Develop a mechanism within the PRD parsing workflow to identify 'complex' tasks that are candidates for auto-expansion. This mechanism should be triggered only when the 'Append + Auto-Expand' option is enabled.
### Details:
After initial task parsing, iterate through the generated tasks. Implement a function `is_complex_task(task)` that returns a boolean. Criteria for complexity should include: description length (e.g., > N characters), presence of keywords (e.g., 'integrate', 'implement', 'design', 'complex'), or predefined feature scope tags. This function will mark tasks for potential expansion.

## 3. Integrate Existing Task Expansion Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 30.2
### Description: Incorporate the existing task expansion logic (currently used by the `expand` command) into the `parse-prd` workflow. This integration should occur after initial parsing and complexity identification, and only for tasks marked as complex.
### Details:
Refactor the existing expansion logic from the `expand` command into a reusable module or function. Call this function for each task identified as complex by the previous step. Ensure the expansion process uses the same AI models and criteria as the standalone `expand` command. Handle the output of the expansion (subtasks) by replacing the original complex task with its expanded subtasks in the parsed task list.

## 4. Implement User Progress Feedback [pending]
### Dependencies: 30.3
### Description: Provide real-time progress feedback to the user during the auto-expansion process, especially when multiple complex tasks are being expanded, as AI model calls can be time-consuming.
### Details:
Add logging or print statements to indicate: 1) when auto-expansion starts, 2) which task is currently being processed for expansion (e.g., 'Expanding task: 'Task Title''), and 3) when expansion for a task is complete. Consider using a progress bar or spinner for a better user experience if feasible.

## 5. End-to-End Validation and Refinement [pending]
### Dependencies: 30.4
### Description: Perform comprehensive end-to-end testing of the integrated auto-expansion feature. Refine the complexity identification criteria and expansion integration based on test results to ensure quality and adherence to requirements.
### Details:
Test with a variety of PRD documents, including those with no complex tasks, a few complex tasks, and many complex tasks. Verify that: 1) non-complex tasks are not expanded, 2) complex tasks are expanded correctly, 3) the overall task hierarchy is maintained, 4) performance is acceptable, and 5) error handling is robust. Adjust complexity thresholds (e.g., description length, keyword list) and AI model parameters if necessary to optimize expansion quality.
