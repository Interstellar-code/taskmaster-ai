# Description: Design and implement the `prds.json` schema to store comprehensive metadata for each PRD, including ID, title, status, file paths, linked tasks, and task statistics.
# Details:
Create a Python class or data structure representing the PRD metadata as per the `prds.json` schema in the PRD. Implement functions to read from and write to `prds.json` ensuring data integrity and thread-safe operations. Include fields for `id`, `title`, `fileName`, `status`, `complexity`, `createdDate`, `lastModified`, `filePath`, `fileHash`, `fileSize`, `description`, `tags`, `linkedTaskIds`, `taskStats`, `estimatedEffort`, and `priority`. The `taskStats` object should include `totalTasks`, `completedTasks`, `pendingTasks`, `inProgressTasks`, and `completionPercentage`.

# Test Strategy:
Create dummy PRD metadata and save it to `prds.json`. Read the data back and assert that all fields are correctly stored and retrieved. Test concurrent read/write operations to ensure data consistency.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Core PRD Metadata Schema [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish the initial structure and data types for the PRD metadata schema, including mandatory and optional fields, their types (string, integer, date, enum, etc.), and any initial constraints.
### Details:
Identify key PRD attributes like ID, Title, Version, Status, Author, CreationDate, LastModifiedDate, etc. Consider using a schema definition language (e.g., JSON Schema, Protobuf IDL).

## 2. Implement Schema Management and Validation [done]
### Dependencies: 40.1
### Description: Develop mechanisms to manage schema versions, validate incoming PRD metadata against the defined schema, and handle schema evolution (e.g., adding new fields, modifying existing ones).
### Details:
Include functions for schema registration, retrieval, and validation. Consider backward and forward compatibility for schema changes.

## 3. Develop PRD Metadata Read Functions [done]
### Dependencies: 40.1
### Description: Implement functions for reading PRD metadata from the persistent storage. This includes functions for retrieving single records, lists, and potentially filtered or paginated results.
### Details:
Focus on efficient data retrieval and deserialization into the defined schema structure. Consider indexing strategies for performance.

## 4. Develop PRD Metadata Write Functions [done]
### Dependencies: 40.1, 40.2
### Description: Implement functions for writing (creating, updating, deleting) PRD metadata to the persistent storage. Ensure data integrity constraints are enforced during write operations.
### Details:
Include validation before write operations. Implement atomic operations where necessary to prevent partial updates. Handle error conditions gracefully.

## 5. Implement Data Integrity and Consistency Checks [done]
### Dependencies: 40.4
### Description: Develop and integrate mechanisms to ensure the integrity and consistency of PRD metadata, including referential integrity, uniqueness constraints, and data type enforcement.
### Details:
This might involve database-level constraints, application-level validation rules, and periodic data audits. Define rollback strategies for failed transactions.

## 6. Implement Thread Safety for Metadata Operations [done]
### Dependencies: 40.3, 40.4
### Description: Ensure that all read and write operations on the PRD metadata are thread-safe to prevent race conditions and data corruption in concurrent environments.
### Details:
Utilize appropriate synchronization primitives (e.g., locks, mutexes, semaphores) or concurrent data structures. Design for high concurrency where possible.
