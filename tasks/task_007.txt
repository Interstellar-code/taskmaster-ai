# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Session Management and Context Awareness
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement session management to maintain menu state, user preferences, and display relevant project information and status indicators in the menu header.
# Details:
Maintain the current menu path (breadcrumb navigation) throughout the session. Implement logic to display current project information (e.g., 'Project: taskmaster-ai'), task counts ('Tasks: 15 total (3 pending)'), and system status ('Status: ✓ Configured') in the menu header. This will require integrating with the existing project and task management core functionalities to retrieve real-time data. Consider how to remember user preferences for future enhancements.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that breadcrumb navigation accurately reflects the current menu location. Check that project name, task counts, and status indicators in the header update dynamically and accurately based on the project's state. Test navigating through multiple levels and returning to ensure state is maintained.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Session State Structure and Persistence [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the data structure for storing session-specific information, including current menu path (breadcrumbs) and placeholders for user preferences. Establish a mechanism for persisting this state across user interactions within a session.
### Details:
Create a `SessionState` object or similar structure. For initial implementation, use in-memory storage (e.g., a singleton or application-scoped bean) for simplicity. Consider how this state will be accessed and updated by different parts of the application. Define clear getters and setters for menu path and preference placeholders.

## 2. Implement Menu Path (Breadcrumb) Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Develop the logic to capture and update the current menu path (breadcrumb navigation) within the defined session state as the user navigates through the application's menu structure.
### Details:
Modify menu navigation handlers to push/pop menu items onto/from a stack or list within the `SessionState` object. Ensure the breadcrumb accurately reflects the user's current location. Consider how to handle direct URL access to specific pages (e.g., reset breadcrumbs or reconstruct them based on URL).

## 3. Integrate Project and Task Data Retrieval [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Implement the necessary service calls or data access logic to retrieve real-time project information (name) and task counts (total, pending) from the existing project and task management core functionalities.
### Details:
Identify or create specific API endpoints/methods within the project and task management modules that can provide: 1) The currently active project's name. 2) The total count of tasks associated with the active project. 3) The count of pending tasks for the active project. Ensure these calls are efficient and handle cases where no project is active or no tasks exist.

## 4. Develop Menu Header Display Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2, 7.3
### Description: Implement the front-end logic to dynamically display the current project information, task counts, and a static system status ('Status: ✓ Configured') in the menu header, utilizing the data retrieved in previous steps.
### Details:
Modify the menu header template or component to include placeholders for 'Project: [name]', 'Tasks: [total] total ([pending] pending)', and 'Status: ✓ Configured'. Bind these placeholders to the data retrieved from the session state (for breadcrumbs) and the project/task data retrieval logic. Ensure the header updates reactively to changes in the underlying data.

## 5. Refine Session State and Prepare for Preferences [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.4
### Description: Review the session state implementation for robustness and extensibility. Add a placeholder for user preferences within the session state, even if the preference management logic isn't fully implemented yet, to prepare for future enhancements.
### Details:
Refactor the `SessionState` object if necessary to ensure it's well-structured and easily extendable. Add a dedicated field (e.g., a map or a nested object) within `SessionState` to hold user preferences. Document the intended use of this field for future preference management features. Ensure the current session management is stable and handles edge cases gracefully.
