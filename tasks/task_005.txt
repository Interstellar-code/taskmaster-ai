# Task ID: 5
# Title: Integrate Analysis, Help, and Settings Menus
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the 'Analysis & Dependencies', 'Help & Information', and 'Settings' menu categories, integrating them with their respective functionalities and ensuring proper context awareness.
# Details:
Create sub-menus for 'Analysis & Dependencies' (analyze-complexity, complexity-report, add-dependency, remove-dependency, validate-dependencies, fix-dependencies), 'Help & Information' (Command Reference, Quick Start Guide, Keyboard Shortcuts), and 'Settings' (Toggle Research Mode, Set Default File Paths, Debug Mode). For 'Settings', ensure integration with `.taskmasterconfig` for reading and updating settings. Implement contextual help and suggestions where appropriate.

# Test Strategy:
Test navigation and functionality within 'Analysis & Dependencies', 'Help & Information', and 'Settings' menus. Verify that settings changes are reflected in `.taskmasterconfig`. Check for contextual information and suggestions where implemented.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement 'Analysis & Dependencies' Menu Structure and Basic Actions [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the 'Analysis & Dependencies' top-level menu and its sub-items: 'Analyze Complexity', 'Complexity Report', 'Add Dependency', 'Remove Dependency', 'Validate Dependencies', and 'Fix Dependencies'. For this subtask, focus on the menu structure and placeholder actions that can be triggered (e.g., logging a message when an item is clicked), without implementing the full backend logic for each action.
### Details:
Utilize the existing menu framework. Each menu item should have a basic event handler that, for now, simply logs the action to the console or displays a simple 'Not yet implemented' message. Ensure proper menu hierarchy and naming.

## 2. Implement 'Help & Information' Menu Structure and Basic Actions [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Create the 'Help & Information' top-level menu and its sub-items: 'Command Reference', 'Quick Start Guide', and 'Keyboard Shortcuts'. Similar to the Analysis menu, focus on the menu structure and placeholder actions.
### Details:
Integrate these menu items into the UI. For 'Command Reference' and 'Quick Start Guide', consider opening a simple modal or a new tab with placeholder content. For 'Keyboard Shortcuts', a simple display of common shortcuts (even if hardcoded for now) would suffice. Ensure proper menu hierarchy and naming.

## 3. Implement 'Settings' Menu Structure and `.taskmasterconfig` Integration [done]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Create the 'Settings' top-level menu and its sub-items: 'Toggle Research Mode', 'Set Default File Paths', and 'Debug Mode'. Implement the initial integration with `.taskmasterconfig` for reading and displaying current settings, and for saving basic changes (e.g., toggling a boolean setting).
### Details:
The 'Settings' menu items should reflect the current state read from `.taskmasterconfig`. 'Toggle Research Mode' and 'Debug Mode' should be checkboxes or toggle switches that update the config file upon change. 'Set Default File Paths' can initially be a text input that reads/writes a path string. Implement robust error handling for config file operations.

## 4. Implement Contextual Help and Suggestions Framework [done]
### Dependencies: 5.3
### Description: Develop a basic framework for providing contextual help and suggestions. This involves identifying key UI elements or states where help might be beneficial and implementing a mechanism to display relevant information (e.g., tooltips, status bar messages, or small pop-ups).
### Details:
Identify at least 2-3 specific UI elements (e.g., a specific input field, a button, or a menu item) where contextual help would be useful. Implement a mechanism (e.g., on-hover tooltips, a dedicated help panel that updates based on focus, or status bar messages) to display pre-defined help text. This framework should be extensible for future additions.

## 5. Refine Menu Interactions and Integrate Placeholder Functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 5.4
### Description: Review all implemented menus ('Analysis', 'Help', 'Settings') and refine their interactions. For 'Analysis' and 'Help' menus, replace simple console logs with more user-friendly placeholder actions (e.g., opening a simple modal with 'Feature coming soon' or a static help document). Ensure all menu items are responsive and provide basic user feedback.
### Details:
For 'Analysis' menu items, instead of just logging, open a small modal indicating the feature is under development. For 'Help' menu items, open a simple static HTML page or a modal with the relevant (even if minimal) content. Ensure consistent styling and responsiveness across all menus. Add basic visual feedback on click (e.g., button press state).
