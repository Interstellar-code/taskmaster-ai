# Description: Optimize menu rendering and command execution performance to meet the specified non-functional requirements, ensuring a responsive and efficient user experience.
# Details:
Profile menu rendering time and command execution time. Implement optimizations such as lazy loading for menu options or command details that are not immediately needed. Minimize unnecessary re-renders of the menu. Ensure that memory usage remains within acceptable limits (< 50MB additional overhead) and startup time is fast (< 500ms).

# Test Strategy:
Measure menu rendering time using profiling tools. Execute various commands through the menu and measure their execution times, comparing them to direct CLI execution. Monitor memory usage during menu operation. Verify startup time of the menu system.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Establish Performance Baselines and Monitoring [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Before implementing optimizations, establish clear performance baselines for menu rendering time, command execution time, memory usage, and startup time. Implement robust monitoring tools to track these metrics.
### Details:
Use browser developer tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools Performance tab) for profiling rendering and execution times. For memory, use the Memory tab. For startup time, measure the time from application launch to full interactivity. Integrate a simple logging mechanism or a dedicated performance monitoring library if available to capture these metrics programmatically.

## 2. Implement Lazy Loading for Menu Options and Command Details [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Optimize menu rendering by implementing lazy loading for menu options or command details that are not immediately visible or required upon initial menu display.
### Details:
Identify parts of the menu structure or command details that can be loaded asynchronously. For example, if a submenu has many items, only load the first few and fetch more as the user scrolls or hovers. For command details, load comprehensive descriptions or complex parameters only when a command is selected or about to be executed. Use techniques like React.lazy() and Suspense if applicable, or custom component-level lazy loading logic.

## 3. Optimize Menu Re-rendering and Component Updates [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Description: Minimize unnecessary re-renders of the menu components to improve responsiveness and reduce CPU cycles.
### Details:
Analyze component re-renders using profiling tools (e.g., React DevTools Profiler). Implement memoization techniques (e.g., React.memo, useCallback, useMemo) for functional components and PureComponent/shouldComponentUpdate for class components. Ensure that state updates are granular and only trigger re-renders for affected components. Avoid passing new object/array references as props unnecessarily.

## 4. Refactor Command Execution Logic for Efficiency [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.3
### Description: Optimize the execution path of commands to ensure they run efficiently and do not block the UI thread.
### Details:
Identify computationally intensive parts of command execution. If possible, offload heavy computations to web workers or process them asynchronously. Minimize synchronous operations that could block the main thread. Review data structures and algorithms used in command processing for efficiency. Cache results of frequently executed commands or expensive computations where appropriate.

## 5. Conduct Comprehensive Performance Regression Testing and Reporting [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4
### Description: After implementing optimizations, conduct thorough regression testing to ensure performance improvements are sustained and no new bottlenecks are introduced. Generate a final performance report.
### Details:
Re-run all performance baseline tests established in Subtask 1. Compare current metrics against baselines and target non-functional requirements. Document all findings, including improvements, any regressions, and remaining areas for optimization. Ensure memory usage is within limits and startup time is fast. Provide a summary report with recommendations for future performance monitoring.
