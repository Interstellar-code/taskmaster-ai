# Description: Conduct comprehensive testing across different terminal environments (Windows PowerShell, macOS Terminal, Linux terminals) to ensure cross-platform compatibility. Perform integration testing with the existing PRD tracking system and menu system. Document all new features and usage.
# Details:
Execute the test scenarios outlined in the PRD's 'Testing Strategy' section. This includes unit tests for UI components, integration tests for data flow and menu integration, and extensive cross-platform testing. Document the 'ðŸ“Š PRD Kanban Board' option in the Project Management menu, provide a user guide for navigation and shortcuts, and update technical documentation for the terminal UI architecture and integration points.

# Test Strategy:
Run the full suite of test scenarios on Windows, macOS, and Linux terminals. Verify consistent behavior and visual rendering. Conduct user acceptance testing with target users. Review all updated documentation for accuracy and completeness.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Plan Comprehensive Testing Strategy [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a detailed test plan outlining methodologies, scope, environments (Windows, macOS, Linux terminals), test cases for cross-platform and integration testing, and bug reporting/resolution processes.
### Details:
Define specific test scenarios for UI elements, functionality, performance, and compatibility across all target operating systems. Outline the bug lifecycle from reporting to verification.

## 2. Execute Cross-Platform UI/UX Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 58.1
### Description: Perform thorough UI/UX testing on Windows, macOS, and Linux terminal environments, identifying and reporting any platform-specific issues, visual discrepancies, or functional bugs.
### Details:
Systematically test all user interface components, navigation, and user experience flows on each specified platform. Document all findings in the designated bug tracking system.

## 3. Conduct Integration Testing with Existing Systems [pending]
### Dependencies: 58.1
### Description: Execute integration tests to ensure seamless interaction and data flow between the new Kanban board system and the existing PRD tracking and menu systems.
### Details:
Verify data consistency, command execution, and menu navigation when interacting with the PRD tracking and menu systems. Report any integration failures or inconsistencies.

## 4. Develop User-Facing Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 58.2, 58.3
### Description: Create a comprehensive user guide for the Kanban board, including instructions on usage, features, and a list of keyboard shortcuts. Ensure clarity and ease of understanding for end-users.
### Details:
Produce a user manual covering all functionalities of the Kanban board, from basic task management to advanced features. Include screenshots and step-by-step instructions. Document all available shortcuts.

## 5. Create Technical Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 58.2, 58.3
### Description: Document the UI architecture of the Kanban board and its integration points with other systems, providing essential information for future development and maintenance.
### Details:
Detail the UI component structure, data flow, API endpoints used for integration, and any specific technical considerations for the Kanban board. This document should serve as a reference for developers.
