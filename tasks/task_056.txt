# Description: Implement terminal-based board navigation controls: 'F' for filter mode, '/' for search mode, 'C' for board statistics, 'H' for help overlay, 'Q' to exit, and Tab key for cycling sections. The status bar should always show the current mode and available shortcuts.
# Details:
Implement event listeners for 'F', '/', 'C', 'H', 'Q', and Tab keys. 'F' should toggle a filter mode (e.g., by priority, complexity). '/' should activate a search input for PRD titles/IDs. 'C' should display overall board statistics in the status bar. 'H' should show an overlay with all keyboard shortcuts. 'Q' should exit the Kanban view. Tab should cycle focus between different board sections (columns, filters, help). The status bar needs to be dynamically updated to reflect the current mode and relevant shortcuts.

# Test Strategy:
Test each navigation key ('F', '/', 'C', 'H', 'Q', Tab). Verify that filter and search modes activate correctly. Check that board statistics are displayed. Confirm the help overlay appears and 'Q' exits the board. Ensure Tab cycles through board sections as expected.
