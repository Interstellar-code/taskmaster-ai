# Description: Set up the basic terminal UI framework using Blessed.js, consistent with the existing TaskMaster task Kanban implementation. This includes initializing the screen, creating a basic layout, and ensuring cross-platform compatibility for the terminal environment.
# Details:
Utilize Blessed.js to create the terminal screen and basic layout. Ensure the setup is robust for cross-platform compatibility (Windows PowerShell, macOS Terminal, Linux terminals). The initial layout should be a blank canvas ready for column and card rendering. Refer to existing TaskMaster task Kanban implementation for best practices and consistent setup.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that a blank Blessed.js screen initializes without errors across different terminal environments. Check for basic keyboard input responsiveness (e.g., 'Q' to quit) to ensure the framework is active.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Blessed.js Screen and Basic Layout [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the core Blessed.js screen object, configure basic terminal properties (e.g., smart CSR), and create a main container element to serve as the root for the UI. Implement a basic 'quit' functionality on 'q', 'C-c', or 'escape' key presses.
### Details:
This involves importing blessed, calling `blessed.screen()`, setting `screen.key(['escape', 'q', 'C-c'], function(ch, key) { return process.exit(0); });`, creating `blessed.box()` for the main container, appending it to the screen, and calling `screen.render()`.

## 2. Implement Cross-Platform Compatibility Checks and Error Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 49.1
### Description: Add checks to ensure the terminal environment is suitable for Blessed.js (e.g., checking for TTY, basic terminal capabilities) and implement robust error handling for common initialization failures. Log relevant environment details for debugging.
### Details:
This includes checking `process.stdout.isTTY` and `process.stdin.isTTY`. Wrap screen initialization in try-catch blocks to gracefully handle errors like unsupported terminals or missing dependencies. Log terminal type (`process.env.TERM`) and other relevant environment variables.

## 3. Manage Dependencies and Project Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure Blessed.js is correctly installed and managed as a project dependency. Set up a basic `package.json` if not already present, and include instructions for installing Blessed.js.
### Details:
This involves running `npm init -y` (if no package.json) and `npm install blessed`. Document these steps in a README or setup instructions. Consider adding a simple start script in `package.json`.
