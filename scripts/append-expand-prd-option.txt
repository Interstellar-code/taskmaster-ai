# Product Requirements Document - Enhanced PRD Parsing with Auto-Expansion

**Project Name:** Enhanced PRD Parsing with Append + Auto-Expand Option
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-06-01
**Author(s):** Development Team
**Stakeholders:** TaskMaster Users, Development Team

---

## üìã Executive Summary

**Problem Statement:**
Currently, when parsing PRDs with existing tasks, users can only append new tasks. However, they then need to manually expand complex tasks into subtasks in a separate step. This creates additional workflow friction and reduces the efficiency of the PRD-to-task generation process.

**Solution Overview:**
Add a new "Append + Auto-Expand" option to the PRD parsing workflow that automatically appends new tasks AND intelligently expands complex tasks into subtasks during the same operation, creating a more comprehensive task breakdown in one step.

**Business Impact:**
- Reduced workflow friction for users
- More comprehensive task breakdowns automatically generated
- Better project planning with detailed subtask structures
- Enhanced productivity for project managers and developers

**Success Metrics:**
- New parsing option successfully implemented and functional
- Users can generate both main tasks and subtasks in single PRD parse operation
- Subtasks properly inherit PRD source metadata from parent tasks
- User adoption of new option measured through usage analytics

## üéØ Project Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. Add "Append + Auto-Expand" option to existing PRD parsing workflow within 2-3 days
2. Ensure subtasks automatically inherit PRD source context from parent tasks
3. Maintain backward compatibility with existing append-only functionality

### Secondary Goals
- Improve user experience with streamlined workflow
- Enhance task granularity for better project management
- Provide intelligent expansion based on task complexity

### Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
- Modifying existing task expansion logic
- Changing core PRD parsing algorithms
- UI/UX redesign beyond adding the new option

## ‚öôÔ∏è Functional Requirements

### Core Features

#### Feature 1: Enhanced Parse PRD Menu Option
**Description:** Add new "Append + Auto-Expand" option to the PRD parsing menu
**Priority:** High
**User Story:** As a user, I want to append new tasks and automatically expand them into subtasks so that I can create comprehensive task breakdowns in one operation

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] New menu option "‚ûï Append new tasks + Auto-expand complex tasks" added to parse PRD workflow
- [ ] Option appears when existing tasks are detected during PRD parsing
- [ ] Option is clearly labeled and distinguishable from existing "Append new tasks" option
- [ ] Menu maintains existing options for backward compatibility
- [ ] User can select the new option using arrow keys and enter

**Dependencies:** None

#### Feature 2: Auto-Expansion Logic Integration
**Description:** Integrate automatic task expansion into the PRD parsing workflow
**Priority:** High
**User Story:** As a user, I want complex tasks to be automatically expanded into subtasks during PRD parsing so that I get detailed task breakdowns without manual intervention

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] System automatically identifies complex tasks suitable for expansion
- [ ] Auto-expansion uses existing task expansion logic and AI models
- [ ] Expansion criteria based on task complexity, description length, and feature scope
- [ ] Only tasks meeting expansion criteria are automatically expanded
- [ ] Expansion process maintains all existing functionality and quality

**Dependencies:** Feature 1 (Enhanced Parse PRD Menu Option)

#### Feature 3: PRD Context Inheritance for Auto-Generated Subtasks
**Description:** Ensure auto-generated subtasks properly inherit PRD source metadata
**Priority:** High
**User Story:** As a user, I want auto-generated subtasks to maintain traceability to the original PRD so that I can track requirements from subtasks back to source documents

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Auto-generated subtasks inherit complete prdSource metadata from parent tasks
- [ ] Subtasks maintain same filePath, fileName, fileHash, and parsedDate as parent
- [ ] PRD traceability commands work correctly with auto-generated subtasks
- [ ] Subtask PRD source information displays correctly in task lists and details
- [ ] Change detection works properly for subtasks with inherited PRD context

**Dependencies:** Feature 2 (Auto-Expansion Logic Integration)

### Supporting Features

#### Feature 4: Expansion Criteria Configuration
**Description:** Implement intelligent criteria for determining which tasks should be auto-expanded
**Priority:** Medium
**Rationale:** Ensures only appropriate tasks are expanded, avoiding over-granular task structures

#### Feature 5: User Feedback and Progress Indication
**Description:** Provide clear feedback during the append + auto-expand process
**Priority:** Medium
**Rationale:** Users need visibility into the enhanced parsing process and its results

## üîß Technical Requirements

### System Architecture
**Technology Stack:**
- **CLI Framework:** Commander.js for command handling
- **Interactive UI:** Inquirer.js for menu options and user selection
- **AI Integration:** Existing AI providers for task expansion logic
- **Data Storage:** JSON file system for task persistence

**Architecture Patterns:**
- Extend existing parse-prd command with new workflow option
- Reuse existing task expansion logic from expand command
- Maintain modular separation between parsing and expansion logic

### Performance Requirements
- **Processing Time:** Auto-expansion should add no more than 30% to total PRD parsing time
- **Memory Usage:** Process should handle large PRDs (50+ tasks) without memory issues
- **Responsiveness:** User should receive progress feedback during long operations

### Integration Requirements
- **Existing Commands:** Must integrate seamlessly with current parse-prd workflow
- **AI Models:** Reuse existing AI model configurations for task expansion
- **Data Compatibility:** Generated tasks must be compatible with all existing TaskMaster commands
