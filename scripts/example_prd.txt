## üí° TaskMaster AI Integration Notes

**For TaskMaster AI Users:**
This PRD template is optimized for task generation using TaskMaster AI. When using this template:

1. **Fill in all bracketed placeholders** with your specific project details
2. **Be specific and detailed** in your requirements - more detail leads to better task generation
3. **Use clear, actionable language** in acceptance criteria and deliverables
4. **Include dependencies and priorities** to help TaskMaster create proper task relationships
5. **Aim for 15-25 features/requirements** for optimal task generation (typically creates 20-40 tasks)

**Recommended TaskMaster Commands:**
```bash
# Generate tasks from your completed PRD
task-master parse-prd --input=your-prd-file.txt --num-tasks=25

# Monitor your PRD for changes
task-master check-prd-changes

# View tasks from this specific PRD
task-master tasks-from-prd --prd=your-prd-file.txt
```

**Pro Tips:**
- Save your PRD files in a `docs/` or `requirements/` directory
- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `user-authentication-system-prd.txt`)
- Keep PRDs focused on a single major feature or system component
- Update PRDs as requirements evolve and re-parse to generate updated tasks
