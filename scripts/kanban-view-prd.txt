# Product Requirements Document - Kanban Board View for TaskMaster AI

**Project Name:** Interactive Kanban Board Visualization for TaskMaster AI
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-01-06
**Author(s):** Development Team
**Stakeholders:** TaskMaster Users, Development Team, Project Managers

---

## üìã Executive Summary

**Problem Statement:**
TaskMaster AI currently provides excellent CLI and text-based task management capabilities, but lacks visual task management interfaces that many users expect from modern project management tools. Users must rely on text-based commands and lists to understand project status, task distribution, and workflow progress, which can be inefficient for quick overviews and status updates.

**Solution Overview:**
Implement a terminal-based Kanban board view within TaskMaster's existing CLI interface that provides visual task management capabilities using ASCII art and terminal UI components. The Kanban board will display tasks as text cards organized by status columns, support keyboard navigation for status updates, and integrate seamlessly with the existing interactive menu system.

**Business Impact:**
- Enhanced user experience with terminal-based visual task management
- Faster project status assessment without leaving the CLI environment
- Improved workflow efficiency for CLI-focused users and developers
- Better task overview capabilities within familiar terminal interface
- Zero additional dependencies or external tools required

**Success Metrics:**
- Terminal Kanban board successfully displays all tasks organized by TaskMaster's 3 status columns
- Keyboard navigation allows efficient task status updates between pending/in-progress/done
- ASCII task cards display comprehensive TaskMaster metadata
- Integration with existing interactive menu system is seamless
- Terminal UI remains responsive and visually clear
- User adoption measured through menu usage analytics
