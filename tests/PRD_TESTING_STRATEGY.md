# PRD Features Testing Strategy

## Overview
This document defines the comprehensive testing strategy for all PRD (Product Requirements Document) features in TaskMaster AI. The testing strategy covers unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, performance tests, and cross-platform compatibility tests.

## Scope of PRD Features to Test

### 1. Core PRD Schema and Data Structure (Task 21)
- **prdSource field structure and validation**
- **Backward compatibility with existing tasks**
- **Schema validation for all required fields**
- **Data integrity during task operations**

### 2. PRD Metadata Capture (Task 22)
- **File metadata extraction (path, size, hash, date)**
- **PRD source integration in parse-prd command**
- **File hash calculation accuracy**
- **Cross-platform file path handling**

### 3. PRD Source Display (Task 23)
- **Task list PRD Source column display**
- **Task detail views with PRD information**
- **Project dashboard PRD statistics**
- **Interactive menu PRD source counts**

### 4. PRD Query and Filtering (Task 24)
- **list-prds command functionality**
- **tasks-from-prd filtering**
- **show-prd-source command**
- **PRD-based task filtering in list command**

### 5. PRD Change Detection (Task 25)
- **File hash comparison for change detection**
- **File size monitoring**
- **check-prd-changes command**
- **update-prd-metadata command**

### 6. PRD Re-parsing and Updates (Task 26)
- **reparse-prd command functionality**
- **Task update logic for changed PRDs**
- **New task creation from updated PRDs**
- **PRD history tracking**

### 7. PRD Traceability Reporting (Task 27)
- **prd-traceability-report command**
- **Report generation in multiple formats**
- **Data accuracy in reports**
- **Performance with large datasets**

## Testing Categories

### Unit Tests
- Individual function testing
- Schema validation
- Data transformation
- Error handling
- Edge cases

### Integration Tests
- Command interactions
- Data flow between modules
- File system operations
- Cross-module dependencies

### End-to-End Tests
- Complete user workflows
- CLI command execution
- File parsing and generation
- Multi-step operations

### Performance Tests

- Memory usage optimization
- Command execution speed
- File I/O performance

### Cross-Platform Tests
- Windows, macOS, Linux compatibility
- File path handling differences
- Line ending variations
- Permission handling

## Test Data Requirements

### Sample PRD Files
- Small PRD (< 1KB)
- Medium PRD (1-10KB)
- Large PRD (> 10KB)
- PRD with special characters
- PRD with different encodings
- Invalid/corrupted PRD files

### Test Task Data
- Tasks with PRD sources
- Tasks without PRD sources (manual)
- Tasks with subtasks
- Tasks with complex dependencies
- Mixed PRD source scenarios

### File System Scenarios
- Existing files
- Missing files
- Read-only files
- Invalid paths
- Network paths
- Symbolic links

## Success Criteria

### Coverage Targets
- Unit test coverage: 90%+
- Integration test coverage: 85%+
- End-to-end test coverage: 80%+
- Critical path coverage: 100%

### Performance Benchmarks
- Parse PRD command: < 30 seconds for 10KB file
- List commands: < 2 seconds for 1000 tasks
- Change detection: < 5 seconds for 100 PRD files
- Memory usage: < 500MB for large datasets

### Reliability Standards
- Zero data loss during operations
- Graceful error handling
- Consistent behavior across platforms
- Backward compatibility maintained

## Test Environment Setup

### Dependencies
