      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Simplify PRD Kanban Folder Structure' task into actionable steps, including analysis of current state, design of new structure, implementation of file moves, update of code references, and comprehensive testing. Consider the impact on existing PRD functionalities and the `prd.json` file.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves significant refactoring of a core system (PRD management), impacting file paths, potentially application logic (how PRD status is read from `prd.json` vs. folder), and requiring thorough testing to ensure no regressions. The description mentions updating import paths and changing how archiving works, indicating a non-trivial change. It's not just a simple file move."
