			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the integration of v0.16.0 upstream changes into detailed subtasks, focusing on: 1) Analyzing upstream changes vs. custom features, 2) Consolidating .taskmaster/ directory, 3) Implementing AWS Bedrock support, 4) Implementing Google Vertex AI support, 5) Implementing Azure support, 6) Updating Node.js version, 7) Handling TASK_MASTER_PROJECT_ROOT, 8) Fixing max_tokens bug, 9) Fixing add-task MCP command, 10) Creating and managing the dev_rohit integration branch, 11) Testing each integrated component, and 12) Documenting changes and potential conflicts.",
			"reasoning": "This task is highly complex due to the selective integration of a new upstream version while preserving numerous custom features. It involves significant analysis, potential refactoring (directory structure), multiple new cloud AI integrations, environment variable handling, bug fixes, and careful branch management. Each custom feature needs to be cross-referenced against upstream changes to prevent regressions, and the new AI integrations are substantial features on their own. The existing subtasks are too high-level and don't reflect the true scope."
