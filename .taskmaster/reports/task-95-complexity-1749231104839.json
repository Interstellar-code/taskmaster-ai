      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Kanban Board Integration for PRD Upload' task into actionable subtasks, focusing on UI integration, event handling, state management for modal visibility, and callback implementation for success/error scenarios, including refreshing the PRD list and displaying toast notifications. Also, include a subtask for comprehensive testing.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves UI modifications, event handling, state management, integration of an existing component (`PRDUploadModal`), and implementing callbacks that trigger data refresh and notifications. While not extremely complex, it touches multiple layers of the application (UI, state, data interaction, notifications) and requires careful coordination. The testing strategy is also quite thorough, adding to the complexity. A score of 6 reflects these interconnected parts."
