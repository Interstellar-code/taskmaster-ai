			"expansionPrompt": "Given the existing subtasks, identify and add specific subtasks for comprehensive testing (unit, integration, UI, scenario, performance), documentation (API, user guide), and deployment considerations (feature flags, rollback plan) for the Task Deletion System.",
			"reasoning": "This task is highly complex due to the combination of frontend UI/UX, robust backend logic (cascade deletion, dependency cleanup), and the critical 'undo' functionality. It involves multiple system components, data integrity concerns, and a need for extensive testing across various scenarios, including performance for cascade operations. The undo functionality adds significant complexity in terms of state management and background processing."
