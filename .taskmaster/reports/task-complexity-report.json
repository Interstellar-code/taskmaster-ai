      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Elaborate on implementing dependency validation for task status changes, covering logic in both frontend and backend to prevent invalid moves (e.g., moving to 'done' with pending dependencies) and providing user feedback.",
      "reasoning": "This is a significant logical challenge. It requires checking task dependencies, potentially recursively, and implementing this validation in *both* the frontend (for immediate feedback) and the backend (for data integrity). This involves complex state and data checks."
