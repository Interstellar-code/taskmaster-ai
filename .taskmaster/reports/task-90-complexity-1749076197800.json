      "reasoning": "This task is highly complex due to the combination of frontend UI/UX, robust backend logic (cascade deletion, dependency cleanup), and the critical 'undo' functionality which adds significant state management and background processing. The testing strategy is extensive, covering multiple layers and scenarios, indicating a high level of rigor required. Performance considerations for cascade deletion also add complexity. The existing subtasks are a good start, but more are needed for thorough testing, error handling, and deployment."
