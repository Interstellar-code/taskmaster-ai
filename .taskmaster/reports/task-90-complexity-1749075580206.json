			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Task Deletion System' into detailed subtasks covering frontend UI, backend API, database logic for cascade deletion and dependency cleanup, undo functionality, and comprehensive testing.",
			"reasoning": "This task is complex due to multiple interconnected components: frontend UI (confirmation, warnings), backend API integration, intricate database logic (cascade deletion, dependency cleanup), and a non-trivial undo functionality (soft-delete, background process). Comprehensive testing across unit, integration, UI, and scenario levels further adds to the complexity. The performance testing aspect also indicates potential challenges."
