      "reasoning": "This task is highly complex due to the breadth of testing required across multiple dimensions: functional, validation, data integrity, user experience, error handling, and accessibility. Each of these areas has numerous scenarios and edge cases to cover, requiring meticulous planning and execution. Browser compatibility and performance testing add further layers of complexity.
