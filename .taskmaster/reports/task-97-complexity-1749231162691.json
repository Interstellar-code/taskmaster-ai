      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'UI/UX Refinement and Accessibility Improvements' task into actionable subtasks, focusing on the detailed requirements provided. Ensure each subtask is specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). Consider separate subtasks for styling consistency, feedback mechanisms, drag-and-drop area refinement, accessibility audit and fixes, responsiveness checks, and edge case UI handling. For accessibility, include specific WCAG guidelines or ARIA attributes to be addressed.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves significant UI/UX refinement across multiple areas (styling, feedback, drag-and-drop) and a thorough accessibility review. Each of these areas can be complex and require detailed attention, testing, and potential iteration. The accessibility component alone can be time-consuming due to the need for auditing, implementing ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and color contrast checks. Responsiveness and edge case handling add further layers of complexity. The test strategy also indicates a need for dedicated testing efforts beyond simple unit tests."
