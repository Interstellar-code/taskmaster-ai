      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Task Deletion System' task into detailed subtasks covering frontend UI, backend API, database logic (cascade/soft delete), undo functionality, and comprehensive testing strategies.",
      "reasoning": "This task is complex due to multiple interconnected components: frontend UI (confirmation, warnings), backend API integration, intricate database logic (cascade deletion, dependency cleanup), and a non-trivial undo functionality (soft delete, background process). Comprehensive testing across unit, integration, UI, and scenario levels further adds to the complexity. Performance considerations for large datasets also elevate the score."
