      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'PRD Upload Modal Component Development' task into detailed, actionable subtasks, focusing on the development of `PRDUploadModal.tsx`, `FormFileUpload.tsx` (including drag-and-drop, validation, and visual feedback), integration, upload progress UI, and modal actions. Ensure each subtask is specific enough to be assigned and tracked.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves developing two interconnected React components with significant UI/UX considerations (drag-and-drop, visual feedback for multiple states, progress indicators) and client-side validation. It requires careful integration and attention to detail for a smooth user experience. The dependency on Task 93 (backend endpoint) also adds a layer of integration complexity. The testing strategy is also quite involved, indicating a higher complexity."
