## 2. Project Overview

### 2.1 Problem Statement

**Current State:** TaskMaster currently provides excellent CLI-based task management with a terminal Kanban view, but lacks a modern web interface that can be easily shared, accessed remotely, or used by team members who prefer graphical interfaces.

**Pain Points:**

- **Limited Accessibility:** CLI interface requires technical knowledge and terminal access
- **No Remote Access:** Cannot easily view or manage tasks from different devices or locations
- **Team Collaboration:** Difficult to share task boards with non-technical stakeholders
- **Visual Limitations:** Terminal-based Kanban has display constraints and limited interactivity

### 2.2 Proposed Solution

**Solution Overview:** Create a modern web application that provides a visual Kanban interface for TaskMaster tasks, featuring drag-and-drop functionality, rich text editing, and real-time synchronization with the existing TaskMaster backend through a dedicated REST API layer.

**Key Benefits:**

- **Enhanced Accessibility:** Web-based interface accessible from any device with a browser
- **Improved User Experience:** Modern, intuitive drag-and-drop interface with rich visual feedback
- **Better Collaboration:** Easily shareable localhost URL for team access during development
- **Seamless Integration:** Full compatibility with existing TaskMaster CLI tools and data structures

### 2.3 Target Users

**Primary Users:** TaskMaster users who prefer visual task management interfaces  
**Secondary Users:** Development team members and stakeholders who need task visibility  
**User Personas:** Developers, project managers, and team leads working with TaskMaster projects
