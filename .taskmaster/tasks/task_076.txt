# Description: Integrate the Tiptap rich text editor for the task details and description fields within the modal.
# Details:
Install `tiptap` and its React integration (`@tiptap/react`). Replace standard textareas for `description` and `details` fields in the `TaskModal` with the Tiptap editor component. Configure a basic set of extensions (e.g., `StarterKit` for bold, italic, lists). Ensure the editor can load existing content and emit updated content.

# Test Strategy:
Open the task modal. Verify that the rich text editor loads for the description and details fields. Type some text, apply formatting (bold, italic), and create lists. Ensure the formatting is applied correctly within the editor.
