# Description: Integrate shadcn/ui component library and configure Tailwind CSS for styling within the React application.
# Details:
Follow shadcn/ui installation instructions, which typically involve installing Tailwind CSS, PostCSS, and Autoprefixer, then initializing shadcn/ui components. Configure `tailwind.config.js` to include shadcn/ui presets and custom styles. Ensure `index.css` or `globals.css` imports Tailwind directives.

# Test Strategy:
Add a simple shadcn/ui component (e.g., Button) to `App.tsx` and verify it renders correctly with Tailwind CSS applied. Check for proper styling and responsiveness in the browser.
