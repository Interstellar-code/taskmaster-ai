# Description: Integrate shadcn/ui component library and configure Tailwind CSS for styling within the React application. The integration includes setting up dark mode support, CSS variables, and responsive design capabilities.
# Details:
The integration process involved installing Tailwind CSS v4.1.8, PostCSS, and Autoprefixer. Configured `tailwind.config.js` to include shadcn/ui presets, dark mode support, and CSS variables. Created `postcss.config.js` with @tailwindcss/postcss plugin. Updated `index.css` with Tailwind directives and shadcn/ui CSS variables for light/dark themes. Installed necessary shadcn/ui dependencies and created a utility function for class merging. Implemented a Button component with multiple variants and demonstrated its usage in `App.tsx`. Successfully tested the integration with Vite dev server running on http://localhost:5173/.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the application builds successfully and renders correctly with styled components. Ensure that Tailwind CSS utility classes and shadcn/ui design system are working correctly, including dark mode support and responsive design capabilities. Test the Button component for proper styling and variant functionality. Confirm that the Vite dev server runs without issues and the integration is seamless.
