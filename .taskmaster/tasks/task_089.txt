# Task ID: 89
# Title: Implement Task Editing Interface (MVP)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 87, 86
# Priority: high
# PRD Source: None (manually created)
# Description: Develop the TaskEditModal and enable in-place editing capabilities for task cards, allowing users to modify existing tasks.
# Details:
Implement the TaskEditModal using shadcn/ui and reusable FormComponents. Pre-populate form fields with existing task data. Integrate with PUT/PATCH /api/v1/tasks/{id} endpoint for saving changes. Enable a click-to-edit mechanism on task cards to open the modal. Implement real-time validation and save functionality. The modal should dynamically load task data based on the clicked task card's ID. Ensure proper error handling and user feedback during save operations.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that clicking on a task card opens the TaskEditModal.
2. Confirm that the modal's form fields are pre-populated with the correct data of the selected task.
3. Test updating various fields (e.g., title, description, priority) and saving the changes.
4. Verify that the updated information is reflected on the task card and persists after page refresh.
5. Test validation rules (e.g., required fields, character limits) and ensure appropriate error messages are displayed.
6. Attempt to save with invalid data and confirm that the changes are not applied.
7. Verify that the modal closes correctly after a successful save or cancellation.
8. Check console for any errors during the editing and saving process.
