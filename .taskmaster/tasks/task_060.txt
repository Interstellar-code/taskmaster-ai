# Description: Initialize a new React application using Vite with TypeScript, setting up the basic project structure and configuration files.
# Details:
Use `npm create vite@latest` to scaffold a new React project. Select 'React' and 'TypeScript' as options. Configure `tsconfig.json` for strict type checking and ensure proper alias resolution if needed. Set up basic folder structure for components, pages, and utilities.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the React development server starts successfully and displays the default Vite welcome page. Check TypeScript compilation for any errors.
