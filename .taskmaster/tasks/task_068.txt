# Description: Set up the @dnd-kit library with necessary context providers for drag-and-drop functionality.
# Details:
Wrap the `KanbanBoard` component (or a higher-level component) with `DndContext` from `@dnd-kit/core`. Configure `DndContext` with `sensors` (e.g., `PointerSensor`, `KeyboardSensor`) and `collisionDetection` (e.g., `closestCorners`). Define `onDragEnd` and `onDragOver` handlers to manage drag operations.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the `DndContext` is correctly initialized by adding a simple draggable element within the context. Log drag events to the console to confirm that `onDragStart`, `onDragOver`, and `onDragEnd` callbacks are triggered as expected.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Install @dnd-kit Packages and Dependencies [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install the necessary @dnd-kit packages and any required dependencies to enable drag-and-drop functionality in the TaskMaster Kanban application.
### Details:
Use npm or yarn to install @dnd-kit/core and any other related packages required for setting up the drag-and-drop context.

## 2. Set Up DndContext Provider [pending]
### Dependencies: 68.1
### Description: Configure the DndContext provider with appropriate sensors and collision detection mechanisms.
### Details:
Integrate the DndContext provider into the application, ensuring that sensors for drag-and-drop interactions are correctly set up and collision detection is configured to handle item interactions.

## 3. Configure Drag Overlay and Accessibility Features [pending]
### Dependencies: 68.2
### Description: Implement drag overlay and ensure accessibility features are in place for the drag-and-drop functionality.
### Details:
Set up a drag overlay to provide visual feedback during drag operations and ensure that the drag-and-drop functionality is accessible, including keyboard navigation and screen reader support.
