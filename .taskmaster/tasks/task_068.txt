# Description: Integrate the `react-dnd-kit-tailwind-shadcn-ui` library to provide drag-and-drop functionality for the Kanban board, leveraging its pre-built components and patterns.
# Details:
Instead of setting up `@dnd-kit` from scratch, install and configure the `react-dnd-kit-tailwind-shadcn-ui` library. This library includes all necessary `@dnd-kit` dependencies and provides ready-to-use components and patterns for Kanban boards. The task involves installing the library, understanding its component structure, and setting up the `DndContext` using the library's recommended patterns and examples. This will simplify the implementation of drag-and-drop for tasks and columns.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the `DndContext` is correctly initialized by integrating a simple draggable element using the `react-dnd-kit-tailwind-shadcn-ui` components. Confirm that drag operations (e.g., `onDragStart`, `onDragOver`, `onDragEnd`) are triggered and handled as expected by observing console logs or visual feedback. Ensure basic drag-and-drop of items functions correctly within the provided context.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Install @dnd-kit Packages and Dependencies [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install the necessary @dnd-kit packages and any required dependencies to enable drag-and-drop functionality in the TaskMaster Kanban application.
### Details:
Use npm or yarn to install @dnd-kit/core and any other related packages required for setting up the drag-and-drop context.

## 2. Set Up DndContext Provider [pending]
### Dependencies: 68.1
### Description: Configure the DndContext provider with appropriate sensors and collision detection mechanisms.
### Details:
Integrate the DndContext provider into the application, ensuring that sensors for drag-and-drop interactions are correctly set up and collision detection is configured to handle item interactions.

## 3. Configure Drag Overlay and Accessibility Features [pending]
### Dependencies: 68.2
### Description: Implement drag overlay and ensure accessibility features are in place for the drag-and-drop functionality.
### Details:
Set up a drag overlay to provide visual feedback during drag operations and ensure that the drag-and-drop functionality is accessible, including keyboard navigation and screen reader support.

## 4. Install react-dnd-kit-tailwind-shadcn-ui Library [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install the specialized `react-dnd-kit-tailwind-shadcn-ui` library which provides pre-built components and patterns for drag-and-drop Kanban boards.
### Details:
Use npm or yarn to install `react-dnd-kit-tailwind-shadcn-ui`. This library will replace the need for manual `@dnd-kit` setup and provide integrated solutions for DndContext, sensors, and collision detection.

## 5. Understand and Integrate Library's DndContext Patterns [pending]
### Dependencies: 68.4
### Description: Familiarize with the `react-dnd-kit-tailwind-shadcn-ui` library's recommended patterns for setting up `DndContext` and integrating its components.
### Details:
Review the documentation and examples provided by `react-dnd-kit-tailwind-shadcn-ui` to understand how to properly wrap the Kanban board components with the library's `DndContext` equivalent. Identify how to configure sensors, collision detection, and drag event handlers (`onDragEnd`, `onDragOver`) using the library's abstractions.

## 6. Replace Manual @dnd-kit Setup with Library Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 68.5
### Description: Refactor existing or planned `@dnd-kit` setup to utilize the components and hooks provided by `react-dnd-kit-tailwind-shadcn-ui`.
### Details:
Instead of directly using `@dnd-kit/core` components, integrate the pre-built `react-dnd-kit-tailwind-shadcn-ui` components for draggable items, droppable containers, and the overall drag-and-drop context. Ensure that the visual and functional aspects of drag-and-drop are maintained or improved.
