# Description: Integrate the `react-dnd-kit-tailwind-shadcn-ui` library to provide drag-and-drop functionality for the Kanban board, leveraging its pre-built components and patterns.
# Details:
Instead of setting up `@dnd-kit` from scratch, install and configure the `react-dnd-kit-tailwind-shadcn-ui` library. This library includes all necessary `@dnd-kit` dependencies and provides ready-to-use components and patterns for Kanban boards. The task involves installing the library, understanding its component structure, and setting up the `DndContext` using the library's recommended patterns and examples. This will simplify the implementation of drag-and-drop for tasks and columns.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the `DndContext` is correctly initialized by integrating a simple draggable element using the `react-dnd-kit-tailwind-shadcn-ui` components. Confirm that drag operations (e.g., `onDragStart`, `onDragOver`, `onDragEnd`) are triggered and handled as expected by observing console logs or visual feedback. Ensure basic drag-and-drop of items functions correctly within the provided context.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Install @dnd-kit Packages and Dependencies [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install the necessary @dnd-kit packages and any required dependencies to enable drag-and-drop functionality in the TaskMaster Kanban application.
### Details:
Use npm or yarn to install @dnd-kit/core and any other related packages required for setting up the drag-and-drop context.
<info added on 2025-06-04T08:27:15.629Z>
Completed: Installed @dnd-kit/modifiers package. All required @dnd-kit packages are now available: @dnd-kit/core (6.3.1), @dnd-kit/sortable (10.0.0), @dnd-kit/utilities (3.2.2), and @dnd-kit/modifiers (latest). Dependencies verified and ready for DndContext setup.

## 2. Set Up DndContext Provider [done]
### Dependencies: 68.1
### Description: Configure the DndContext provider with appropriate sensors and collision detection mechanisms.
### Details:
Integrate the DndContext provider into the application, ensuring that sensors for drag-and-drop interactions are correctly set up and collision detection is configured to handle item interactions.
<info added on 2025-06-04T08:36:29.151Z>
Completed: DndContext provider is properly set up in KanbanBoard component with enhanced configuration including accessibility announcements, multiple sensor support (Mouse, Touch, Keyboard, Pointer), and proper event handlers (onDragStart, onDragEnd). The provider wraps the Kanban columns and provides the drag-and-drop context for all child components.

## 3. Configure Drag Overlay and Accessibility Features [done]
### Dependencies: 68.2
### Description: Implement drag overlay and ensure accessibility features are in place for the drag-and-drop functionality.
### Details:
Set up a drag overlay to provide visual feedback during drag operations and ensure that the drag-and-drop functionality is accessible, including keyboard navigation and screen reader support.
<info added on 2025-06-04T08:36:57.699Z>
Completed: DragOverlay is properly configured in KanbanBoard component with TaskCard rendering during drag operations. Accessibility features are fully implemented including comprehensive screen reader announcements for drag start, drag over, drag end, and drag cancel events. The overlay provides visual feedback with proper styling and positioning during drag operations.

## 4. Install react-dnd-kit-tailwind-shadcn-ui Library [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install the specialized `react-dnd-kit-tailwind-shadcn-ui` library which provides pre-built components and patterns for drag-and-drop Kanban boards.
### Details:
Use npm or yarn to install `react-dnd-kit-tailwind-shadcn-ui`. This library will replace the need for manual `@dnd-kit` setup and provide integrated solutions for DndContext, sensors, and collision detection.
<info added on 2025-06-04T08:29:22.151Z>
Completed: Downloaded and organized react-dnd-kit-tailwind-shadcn-ui reference code from GitHub repository (Georgegriff/react-dnd-kit-tailwind-shadcn-ui). Created reference components in src/components/dnd-reference/ including KanbanBoard.tsx, BoardColumn.tsx, TaskCard.tsx, utils.ts, and multipleContainersKeyboardPreset.ts. These provide proven patterns for accessible drag-and-drop implementation with @dnd-kit, shadcn/ui, and Tailwind CSS.

## 5. Understand and Integrate Library's DndContext Patterns [done]
### Dependencies: 68.4
### Description: Familiarize with the `react-dnd-kit-tailwind-shadcn-ui` library's recommended patterns for setting up `DndContext` and integrating its components.
### Details:
Review the documentation and examples provided by `react-dnd-kit-tailwind-shadcn-ui` to understand how to properly wrap the Kanban board components with the library's `DndContext` equivalent. Identify how to configure sensors, collision detection, and drag event handlers (`onDragEnd`, `onDragOver`) using the library's abstractions.
<info added on 2025-06-04T08:35:44.892Z>
Completed: Integrated react-dnd-kit-tailwind-shadcn-ui library patterns into KanbanBoard component. Enhanced DndContext with accessibility announcements, keyboard navigation support (coordinateGetter), touch sensor support, and mouse sensor support. Added helper functions for drag data management and comprehensive screen reader announcements for drag operations. Created utility files (utils.ts, multipleContainersKeyboardPreset.ts) following the proven patterns from the reference library.

## 6. Replace Manual @dnd-kit Setup with Library Components [done]
### Dependencies: 68.5
### Description: Refactor existing or planned `@dnd-kit` setup to utilize the components and hooks provided by `react-dnd-kit-tailwind-shadcn-ui`.
### Details:
Instead of directly using `@dnd-kit/core` components, integrate the pre-built `react-dnd-kit-tailwind-shadcn-ui` components for draggable items, droppable containers, and the overall drag-and-drop context. Ensure that the visual and functional aspects of drag-and-drop are maintained or improved.
