# Task ID: 84
# Title: Enhance TaskMaster API with Advanced Error Handling and Monitoring
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 63, 81
# Priority: medium
# PRD Source: None (manually created)
# Description: Implement comprehensive error handling mechanisms and logging/monitoring systems for the TaskMaster API core function integration.
# Details:
1. Review the existing integration of TaskMaster core functions within the Express.js API (Task 63) to identify all critical integration points.
2. Implement robust error handling at each integration point, ensuring that all potential exceptions are caught and handled gracefully.
3. Develop a centralized logging system using a library such as Winston or Bunyan to capture detailed logs of API requests, errors, and performance metrics.
4. Integrate a monitoring tool like Prometheus or New Relic to track API performance and usage metrics.
5. Design and implement error recovery strategies, such as retry mechanisms or fallback responses, to ensure graceful degradation in case of failures.
6. Ensure that all logs and metrics are stored securely and can be accessed for analysis and debugging purposes.

# Test Strategy:
1. Conduct unit tests to verify that error handling mechanisms correctly catch and handle exceptions at all integration points.
2. Perform integration tests to ensure that the logging system captures accurate and detailed logs of API activity and errors.
3. Use load testing tools to simulate high traffic and verify that the monitoring system accurately tracks performance metrics.
4. Test error recovery strategies by simulating failures and ensuring that the API responds with appropriate fallback mechanisms.
5. Review logs and monitoring data to ensure they provide sufficient detail for debugging and performance analysis.
