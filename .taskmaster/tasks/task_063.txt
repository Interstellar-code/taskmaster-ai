# Description: Integrate existing TaskMaster core functions into the Express.js API server as middleware or utility functions.
# Details:
Identify the relevant TaskMaster core functions for task management (e.g., reading `tasks.json`, updating task status). Create a wrapper module or service in the backend that imports and exposes these functions. Ensure proper error handling and data serialization/deserialization when interacting with the core functions.

# Test Strategy:
Write a simple test route in the Express server that calls a TaskMaster core function (e.g., to read all tasks). Verify that the function executes without errors and returns data in the expected format. Mock core functions if necessary for isolated testing.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up TaskMaster Core Module Imports and Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure the TaskMaster core modules to be imported correctly and ensure they are set up according to the project's requirements. [Updated: 3/6/2025]
### Details:
Review the existing project structure and determine the necessary configuration changes to import TaskMaster core modules. Ensure compatibility with the current setup.
<info added on 2025-06-03T19:08:36.554Z>
Begin implementing the import of TaskMaster core modules and make the necessary configuration adjustments to ensure seamless integration with the existing project setup.
