# Description: Integrate existing TaskMaster core functions into the Express.js API server as middleware or utility functions.
# Details:
Identify the relevant TaskMaster core functions for task management (e.g., reading `tasks.json`, updating task status). Create a wrapper module or service in the backend that imports and exposes these functions. Ensure proper error handling and data serialization/deserialization when interacting with the core functions.

# Test Strategy:
Write a simple test route in the Express server that calls a TaskMaster core function (e.g., to read all tasks). Verify that the function executes without errors and returns data in the expected format. Mock core functions if necessary for isolated testing.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up TaskMaster Core Module Imports and Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure the TaskMaster core modules to be imported correctly and ensure they are set up according to the project's requirements.
### Details:
Review the existing project structure and determine the necessary configuration changes to import TaskMaster core modules. Ensure compatibility with the current setup.

## 2. Create API Middleware for TaskMaster Function Calls [pending]
### Dependencies: 63.1
### Description: Develop middleware to facilitate API calls to TaskMaster core functions, ensuring smooth communication between the front-end and back-end.
### Details:
Design and implement middleware that handles requests and responses for TaskMaster core functions, ensuring they are accessible via the API.

## 3. Implement Error Handling for Core Function Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 63.2
### Description: Develop robust error handling mechanisms for the integration of TaskMaster core functions to ensure system stability and reliability.
### Details:
Identify potential failure points in the integration process and implement error handling strategies to manage exceptions and errors gracefully.

## 4. Add Logging and Monitoring for Core Function Usage [pending]
### Dependencies: 63.3
### Description: Implement logging and monitoring to track the usage and performance of TaskMaster core functions, aiding in maintenance and debugging.
### Details:
Set up logging to capture detailed information about core function calls and integrate monitoring tools to observe performance metrics.
