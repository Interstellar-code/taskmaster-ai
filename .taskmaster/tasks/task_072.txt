# Description: Add visual feedback mechanisms for drag operations, such as hover states for drop zones and a visual representation of the dragged item.
# Details:
Use `@dnd-kit/core`'s `useDraggable` and `useDroppable` hooks to apply CSS classes or inline styles based on drag state. For draggable items, change opacity or add a shadow when dragging. For droppable areas, change background color or border when an item is hovered over them. Consider using `DragOverlay` for a smooth visual representation of the dragged item.

# Test Strategy:
Perform drag operations. Visually confirm that draggable items change appearance when picked up and that droppable columns highlight when a task is dragged over them. Ensure the visual feedback is clear and intuitive.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Drag Overlay and Ghost Elements [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create visual elements that appear during drag operations to enhance user feedback.
### Details:
Design and implement overlay and ghost elements that follow the cursor during drag operations. Ensure these elements are visually distinct and provide clear feedback to the user.

## 2. Add Hover States and Drop Zone Indicators [done]
### Dependencies: 72.1
### Description: Enhance visual feedback by highlighting potential drop zones and providing hover states.
### Details:
Implement visual cues that indicate valid drop zones when a draggable element is hovered over them. Ensure hover states are clear and intuitive.

## 3. Create Smooth Animations and Transitions [done]
### Dependencies: 72.1, 72.2
### Description: Develop animations and transitions to ensure a smooth drag-and-drop experience.
### Details:
Implement animations that provide a seamless transition between drag start, movement, and drop. Focus on performance and user experience.
