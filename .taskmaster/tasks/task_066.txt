# Description: Develop the main Kanban board layout component with three columns for 'pending', 'in-progress', and 'done' task statuses, leveraging the `react-dnd-kit-tailwind-shadcn-ui` library for drag-and-drop functionality.
# Details:
Create a `KanbanBoard` React component using patterns and components from the `react-dnd-kit-tailwind-shadcn-ui` library. This includes setting up the `DndContext` and utilizing its pre-built components for a responsive three-column layout. Each column should represent a task status ('pending', 'in-progress', 'done'). Fetch tasks from the `/api/v1/tasks` endpoint and distribute them into the respective columns based on their `status` property. Display a task count in each column header. The layout should be compatible with the library's drag-and-drop system.

# Test Strategy:
Render the `KanbanBoard` component. Verify that three columns are displayed and tasks are correctly categorized into 'pending', 'in-progress', and 'done' based on their status. Test responsiveness by resizing the browser window to ensure the layout adapts correctly, utilizing the `react-dnd-kit-tailwind-shadcn-ui` library's responsive features. Ensure the basic drag-and-drop setup is functional (though full drag-and-drop functionality will be tested in subsequent tasks).

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Main Kanban Board Container using react-dnd-kit-tailwind-shadcn-ui [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the main `KanbanBoard` React component, setting up the `DndContext` and utilizing the responsive grid layout patterns provided by the `react-dnd-kit-tailwind-shadcn-ui` library.
### Details:
Set up a new React component named `KanbanBoard`. Integrate the `DndContext` from `@dnd-kit/core`. Use the grid or flexbox utilities and components from `react-dnd-kit-tailwind-shadcn-ui` to create a responsive layout that will house three columns. Ensure the layout adjusts for different screen sizes, maintaining a three-column layout on larger screens and stacking columns vertically on smaller screens, following the library's recommended patterns.

## 2. Implement Individual Column Components using react-dnd-kit-tailwind-shadcn-ui patterns [done]
### Dependencies: 66.1
### Description: Create separate components for each task status column: 'Pending', 'In-Progress', and 'Done', leveraging the column patterns from `react-dnd-kit-tailwind-shadcn-ui`.
### Details:
Develop three React components, one for each task status: `PendingColumn`, `InProgressColumn`, and `DoneColumn`. These components should be built using the column components and patterns provided by `react-dnd-kit-tailwind-shadcn-ui` to ensure compatibility with the drag-and-drop system. Each component should accept a list of tasks as props and display them. Ensure these components integrate seamlessly into the `KanbanBoard` layout.

## 3. Add Column Headers with Task Counts using react-dnd-kit-tailwind-shadcn-ui styling [done]
### Dependencies: 66.2
### Description: Enhance each column component with a header that displays the column title and the count of tasks within that column, styled consistently with `react-dnd-kit-tailwind-shadcn-ui`.
### Details:
Modify each column component to include a header section. Use Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components, as integrated by `react-dnd-kit-tailwind-shadcn-ui`, for styling. The header should display the column name and dynamically update to show the number of tasks in that column. Ensure the styling is consistent with the overall design of the Kanban board and the library's aesthetic.

## 4. Implement Responsive Design for Mobile and Tablet Views using react-dnd-kit-tailwind-shadcn-ui [done]
### Dependencies: 66.3
### Description: Ensure the Kanban board layout is fully responsive and provides a good user experience on mobile and tablet devices, leveraging the responsive features of `react-dnd-kit-tailwind-shadcn-ui`.
### Details:
Utilize the responsive utilities and components provided by `react-dnd-kit-tailwind-shadcn-ui` (which in turn uses Tailwind CSS) to adjust the layout for smaller screens. Implement media queries or responsive classes as demonstrated in the library's examples to ensure the columns stack vertically on smaller devices. Test the layout on various screen sizes to ensure usability and readability.
