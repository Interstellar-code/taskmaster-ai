# Description: Implement the functionality to update PRD status using number keys (1-4) to move selected PRDs to corresponding status columns. This includes updating the `prd/prds.json` file, updating column PRD counts, and automatically organizing PRD files into status-based directories.
# Details:
Add event listeners for number keys (1-4). When a PRD is selected and a number key is pressed, update the PRD's status in the in-memory data structure and then persist this change to `prd/prds.json` using existing TaskMaster PRD utilities (e.g., `updatePrdStatus`). Ensure column PRD counts are immediately updated. Crucially, integrate with the existing logic for automatic PRD file organization into status-based directories (pending, in-progress, done, archived) after a status change.

# Test Strategy:
Select a PRD and use number keys (1-4) to move it between columns. Verify that the PRD visually moves to the correct column. Check `prd/prds.json` to confirm the status update is persistent. Verify that the PRD file is moved to the correct status-based directory. Confirm column PRD counts update accurately after each move.
