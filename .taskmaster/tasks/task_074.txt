# Description: Create a modal component using shadcn/ui Dialog to display detailed task information.
# Details:
Create a `TaskModal` React component. Use shadcn/ui's `Dialog` component for the modal structure. This modal should open when a `TaskCard` is clicked. It should display all task properties: `title`, `description`, `details`, `testStrategy`, `dependencies`, `priority`, `status`, `id`.

# Test Strategy:
Click on a `TaskCard`. Verify that the modal opens and displays all the task's properties correctly. Ensure the modal can be closed by clicking outside or using a close button.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Modal Component Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the basic structure of the TaskModal component using shadcn/ui's Dialog component.
### Details:
Initialize a new React component named TaskModal. Utilize the Dialog component from shadcn/ui to form the basic modal structure. Ensure the modal can be opened and closed, but initially, it will not be connected to any specific task data.

## 2. Implement Modal Trigger and State Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 74.1
### Description: Set up the modal to open when a TaskCard is clicked, managing the modal's open/close state.
### Details:
Integrate the TaskModal component with the TaskCard component. Use React state to manage the open/close state of the modal. Ensure that clicking a TaskCard sets the state to open the modal, and clicking outside the modal or a close button sets the state to close it.

## 3. Add Modal Layout and Responsive Design [pending]
### Dependencies: 74.2
### Description: Design the layout of the modal to display task details and ensure it is responsive.
### Details:
Within the TaskModal, layout the task properties: title, description, details, testStrategy, dependencies, priority, status, and id. Use CSS or a styling library to ensure the modal is responsive and visually appealing across different screen sizes.
