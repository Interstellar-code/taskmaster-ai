# File Size: 9423 bytes
# Description: Conduct comprehensive testing of the entire PRD upload feature, covering various scenarios, edge cases, and user experience aspects. This includes validating file handling, PRD registration, UI feedback, and accessibility.
# Details:
1. **File Upload Testing**: Test with a variety of MD/TXT files:
   - Small, medium, and large files (up to 10MB).
   - Files with special characters in their names.
   - Files with different line endings.
   - Empty files.
   - Files with malformed content (if `createPrdFromFile` has content validation).
2. **Validation Testing**: Verify both client-side and server-side validation for:
   - Incorrect file types (e.g., `.pdf`, `.jpg`).
   - Files exceeding the 10MB size limit.
3. **PRD Registration Verification**: After successful uploads, manually verify:
   - Files are correctly stored in the `.taskmaster/prd/` directory.
   - `prds.json` is updated with accurate metadata (ID, title, etc.).
   - The PRD is accessible and viewable within the system.
4. **User Experience (UX) Testing**: 
   - Test toast notifications for success and error states.
   - Verify loading states during upload.
   - Check modal close behavior after successful upload.
   - Ensure the PRD filter dropdown immediately reflects new PRDs.
5. **Error Handling Scenarios**: Simulate and test various error conditions:
   - Network failures during upload.
   - Backend server errors.
   - Storage permission issues.
   - Duplicate file names (how the system handles this).
6. **Accessibility Testing**: Ensure the upload button and modal are keyboard navigable and have proper ARIA labels.

# Test Strategy:
1. **Manual Testing**: Follow a detailed test plan covering all scenarios outlined in the 'Implementation Details'.
2. **Browser Compatibility**: Test the feature across different web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
3. **Performance Testing**: Observe upload times for large files and ensure the UI remains responsive.
4. **Regression Testing**: Ensure existing Kanban board functionalities are not negatively impacted by the new feature.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Develop Test Plan for File Upload Scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a comprehensive test plan document outlining specific test cases for file upload scenarios, including various file sizes, special characters, line endings, and empty files. Define expected outcomes for each case.
### Details:
The test plan should detail test data generation (e.g., creating files of specific sizes, with special characters, etc.) and the steps to execute each test case. Focus on MD/TXT files up to 10MB.

## 2. Implement Automated Tests for File Upload Scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: 96.1
### Description: Write automated test scripts to cover the file upload scenarios defined in the test plan, including small, medium, large, special character, and empty files. Use a testing framework like Playwright or Cypress.
### Details:
Focus on programmatically uploading files and verifying the success of the upload operation. Do not yet focus on PRD registration or content validation.

## 3. Develop Test Plan for Validation Scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: 96.1
### Description: Create a detailed test plan for client-side and server-side validation, covering incorrect file types (e.g., .pdf, .jpg) and files exceeding the 10MB size limit. Define expected error messages and UI behavior.
### Details:
The plan should specify how to generate invalid files and large files, and the expected error messages or UI feedback for each validation failure.

## 4. Implement Automated Tests for Validation Scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: 96.3
### Description: Write automated test scripts to verify both client-side and server-side validation for incorrect file types and files exceeding the size limit. Assert that appropriate error messages are displayed and files are not uploaded.
### Details:
Use the testing framework to simulate invalid file uploads and assert on the presence of specific error messages or the absence of successful upload indicators.

## 5. Manual Verification of PRD Registration and Storage [pending]
### Dependencies: 96.2, 96.4
### Description: Manually test and verify that after successful file uploads, PRDs are correctly stored in the `.taskmaster/prd/` directory, `prds.json` is updated with accurate metadata, and the PRD is accessible within the system.
### Details:
Perform uploads using the UI, then manually inspect the file system and the `prds.json` file. Verify the PRD ID, title, and other metadata. Navigate to the PRD within the application to confirm accessibility.

## 6. Develop Test Plan for User Experience (UX) Scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a test plan for UX elements including toast notifications (success/error), loading states, modal close behavior, and immediate reflection of new PRDs in the filter dropdown.
### Details:
The plan should detail steps to trigger each UX state and the expected visual and functional behavior. Include scenarios for both successful and failed uploads.

## 7. Manual Verification of User Experience (UX) Elements [pending]
### Dependencies: 96.6
### Description: Manually test and verify all defined UX scenarios, ensuring toast notifications are correct, loading states are visible, modal closes appropriately, and the PRD filter dropdown updates instantly.
### Details:
Perform uploads under various conditions (success, error, large file) and observe the UI behavior. Pay close attention to timing and visual feedback.

## 8. Develop Test Plan for Error Handling Scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a test plan for simulating and testing various error conditions: network failures, backend server errors, storage permission issues, and duplicate file names. Define expected system responses.
### Details:
The plan should outline methods for simulating these errors (e.g., using network throttling, mock server responses, or file system permission changes) and the expected error messages or recovery mechanisms.

## 9. Implement Manual Tests for Error Handling Scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: 96.8
### Description: Manually execute tests for error handling scenarios, including network failures, backend errors, storage permission issues, and duplicate file names. Verify the system's graceful degradation and error reporting.
### Details:
Use developer tools to simulate network conditions. Coordinate with backend team to simulate server errors. Attempt to upload files with duplicate names to observe behavior.

## 10. Develop Test Plan for Accessibility (A11y) Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a test plan specifically for accessibility, focusing on keyboard navigation and ARIA labels for the upload button and modal. Define expected tab order, focus management, and screen reader announcements.
### Details:
The plan should include steps for using keyboard-only navigation and a screen reader (e.g., NVDA, VoiceOver) to interact with the upload components.

## 11. Manual Verification of Accessibility (A11y) Features [pending]
### Dependencies: 96.10
### Description: Manually test the accessibility of the upload button and modal using keyboard navigation and a screen reader. Verify correct tab order, focus management, and appropriate ARIA labels and announcements.
### Details:
Navigate through the UI using only the keyboard (Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Space). Use a screen reader to listen to the announcements for interactive elements and form fields.

## 12. Consolidate Test Results and Report Bugs [pending]
### Dependencies: 96.5, 96.7, 96.9, 96.11
### Description: Gather all test results from automated and manual testing, consolidate findings, and create a comprehensive bug report for any identified issues across all testing areas (file handling, validation, UX, error handling, accessibility).
### Details:
Prioritize bugs based on severity and impact. Ensure clear steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual results, and relevant logs/screenshots are included for each bug.
