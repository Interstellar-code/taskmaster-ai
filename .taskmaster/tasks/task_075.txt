# Description: Implement the display of all task metadata within the task detail modal.
# Details:
Populate the `TaskModal` with input fields or display elements for each task property. For editable fields like `title`, `description`, `details`, and `testStrategy`, use appropriate input components. For `priority`, `status`, and `dependencies`, display them clearly, potentially using badges or lists.

# Test Strategy:
Open the task modal for various tasks with different data. Verify that all fields are populated correctly and that the data matches the task selected. Check for proper formatting of dependencies and priorities.
