# Description: Add loading states, error boundaries, and user feedback systems (e.g., toast notifications) for a better user experience.
# Details:
Implement loading indicators (e.g., spinners) for API calls and data fetching. Use React Error Boundaries to gracefully handle unexpected errors in components and display fallback UI. Integrate a toast notification library (e.g., `react-hot-toast` or shadcn/ui's `Toast`) to provide ephemeral feedback for successful operations, warnings, and errors.

# Test Strategy:
Simulate slow network conditions to verify loading states appear. Introduce a controlled error in a component to test the error boundary. Trigger various actions (e.g., saving a task, failing an API call) and verify that appropriate toast notifications are displayed to the user.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Loading Spinner and Skeleton Components [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop reusable loading spinner and skeleton components to enhance user experience during data fetching.
### Details:
Design and implement loading spinner and skeleton components that can be used across the application to indicate loading states.

## 2. Implement React Error Boundaries [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add React error boundaries to handle errors gracefully and prevent the application from crashing.
### Details:
Implement error boundaries in key components to catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI.

## 3. Add Toast Notifications for User Feedback [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate a toast notification system to provide users with feedback on their actions and system events.
### Details:
Implement a toast notification library to display messages for successful operations, errors, and other important events.

## 4. Create Loading States for All Async Operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 81.1
### Description: Ensure all asynchronous operations have appropriate loading states to inform users of ongoing processes.
### Details:
Review all asynchronous operations in the application and apply loading states using the previously created spinner and skeleton components.
