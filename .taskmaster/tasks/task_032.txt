# Description: Refine and implement intelligent criteria for determining which tasks should be automatically expanded. This will prevent over-granular task structures and ensure only appropriate tasks are expanded based on their complexity, description length, and feature scope.
# Details:
Develop and implement a configurable set of rules or an algorithm to assess task complexity. This could involve analyzing the length of the task description, the presence of specific keywords (e.g., 'implement', 'integrate', 'design', 'develop'), the number of sub-requirements implied in the description, or a predefined feature scope. The criteria should be flexible enough to be adjusted if needed. The goal is to ensure that only tasks that genuinely benefit from further breakdown are automatically expanded, avoiding unnecessary subtask generation.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for the complexity assessment algorithm with various task descriptions. Integration tests with PRDs containing tasks of varying complexities to verify that the expansion criteria correctly identify and trigger expansion only for the intended tasks. User acceptance testing with different PRD types to validate the appropriateness of the generated subtask granularity.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Initial Expansion Criteria and Data Sources [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify and document the initial set of criteria for intelligent task expansion, including potential data sources within the task object (e.g., description length, keywords, estimated complexity field).
### Details:
Collaborate with product/design to establish a baseline for what constitutes a 'complex' task warranting expansion. Focus on readily available task attributes. Document these criteria clearly, perhaps as a configuration schema or a simple rule set.

## 2. Develop Task Attribute Extraction Module [pending]
### Dependencies: 32.1
### Description: Implement a module responsible for extracting relevant attributes from a given task object based on the defined criteria (e.g., description length, keyword presence, estimated complexity value).
### Details:
Create a utility function or class that takes a task object as input and returns a structured object containing extracted attributes. For keywords, use a predefined list. For description length, count characters or words. Consider using a simple NLP library if keyword matching needs to be more sophisticated (e.g., stemming).

## 3. Implement Configurable Expansion Rule Engine [pending]
### Dependencies: 32.2
### Description: Develop a configurable rule engine that evaluates the extracted task attributes against the defined expansion criteria to determine if a task should be automatically expanded.
### Details:
Design a flexible rule engine that can load rules from a configuration. Rules could be simple boolean expressions (e.g., 'description_length > X AND has_keyword_Y'). The engine should take the output of the attribute extraction module and return a boolean indicating expansion necessity. Consider using a simple JSON-based rule configuration.

## 4. Integrate Expansion Logic into Task Creation/Update Workflow [pending]
### Dependencies: 32.3
### Description: Integrate the developed expansion rule engine into the existing task creation and update workflows to automatically trigger expansion based on the evaluation.
### Details:
Identify the appropriate hooks in the task creation/update process where the expansion logic should be invoked. This might be a service layer call after a task is saved. Ensure that the expansion process is asynchronous if it involves significant computation or external calls, to avoid blocking the main workflow. Handle cases where expansion might fail gracefully.

## 5. Develop Admin Interface for Criteria Management and Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 32.4
### Description: Create a basic administrative interface or configuration mechanism to allow non-developers to view and adjust the expansion criteria and monitor expansion activity.
### Details:
Implement a simple UI or API endpoint that allows viewing and modifying the rule configuration (e.g., keyword lists, length thresholds). Also, consider adding logging or metrics to track how often tasks are expanded by the intelligent criteria, and which criteria are most frequently met. This will aid in future refinement.
