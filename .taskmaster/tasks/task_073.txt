# Description: Implement logic to prevent invalid task moves based on defined task dependencies.
# Details:
Before allowing a task status update (both in frontend drag-and-drop and backend API), check if the task has any pending dependencies. For example, a task cannot be moved to 'done' if its dependencies are not yet 'done'. Implement this validation logic in both the frontend (for immediate user feedback) and the backend (for data integrity).

# Test Strategy:
Create tasks with dependencies. Attempt to drag a task to 'done' when its dependencies are still 'pending' or 'in-progress'. Verify that the move is prevented and appropriate user feedback (e.g., a toast message) is displayed. Test valid moves to ensure they are not blocked.

# Subtasks:
## 73.1. Create dependency validation utility functions [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create utility functions to check task dependencies recursively and validate status transitions
### Details:
Implement functions like `checkTaskDependencies(taskId, tasks)`, `validateStatusTransition(task, newStatus, allTasks)`, and `getDependencyChain(taskId, tasks)` to handle dependency logic

## 73.2. Implement frontend dependency validation in drag-and-drop handlers [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add dependency validation logic to the onDragEnd handler to prevent invalid moves with immediate user feedback
### Details:
Before updating task status in the drag-and-drop handler, call dependency validation functions and show toast notifications for invalid moves

## 73.3. Add backend dependency validation to API endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement dependency validation in the PATCH /api/v1/tasks/:id/status endpoint for data integrity
### Details:
Add validation middleware to check dependencies before allowing status updates, return appropriate error responses for invalid transitions

## 73.4. Create user feedback components for dependency violations [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement toast notifications and visual indicators for dependency validation failures
### Details:
Create reusable components for showing dependency error messages, highlight dependent tasks, and provide clear guidance to users

## 73.5. Add visual dependency indicators in TaskCard components [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Display dependency information and status in task cards to help users understand task relationships
### Details:
Show dependency badges, highlight blocking/blocked tasks, and add visual cues for dependency status in the Kanban board

## 73.6. Implement comprehensive dependency validation testing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive test suite for all dependency validation scenarios and edge cases
### Details:
Test complex dependency chains, circular dependencies, concurrent updates, and error recovery scenarios

## 7. Create Dependency Validation Utility Functions [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop utility functions to check if a task can be moved based on its dependencies.
### Details:
Implement utility functions that take a task and its dependencies as input and return whether the task can be moved to a new status. These functions should be reusable across both frontend and backend.

## 8. Integrate Validation in Frontend Drag-and-Drop [pending]
### Dependencies: 73.7
### Description: Incorporate dependency validation in the frontend drag-and-drop handlers to provide immediate feedback to users.
### Details:
Modify the drag-and-drop event handlers to call the dependency validation utility functions before allowing a task to be moved. Display an error message or visual cue if the move is invalid.

## 9. Implement Backend Validation in API Endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: 73.7
### Description: Add dependency validation logic to the backend API endpoints to ensure data integrity during task status updates.
### Details:
Update the task status update API endpoints to use the dependency validation utility functions. Return an error response if a task move is invalid due to unmet dependencies.

## 10. Develop User Feedback Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 73.8
### Description: Create user feedback mechanisms to inform users why a task move is invalid.
### Details:
Design and implement UI components that display error messages or tooltips explaining why a task cannot be moved due to unmet dependencies.

## 11. Add Visual Dependency Indicators [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Enhance the UI to visually indicate task dependencies, helping users understand task relationships.
### Details:
Implement visual indicators such as icons or lines connecting dependent tasks. Ensure these indicators are clear and do not clutter the UI.

## 12. Conduct Comprehensive Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 73.8, 73.9, 73.10, 73.11
### Description: Perform comprehensive testing to ensure all aspects of dependency validation are functioning correctly.
### Details:
Execute a combination of unit, integration, and user acceptance tests to validate the entire dependency validation feature. Ensure that both frontend and backend validations are robust and user feedback is effective.
