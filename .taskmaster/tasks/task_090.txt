# Task ID: 90
# Title: Implement Task Deletion System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 87, 86, 84
# Priority: medium
# PRD Source: None (manually created)
# Description: Develop a robust task deletion system, including a confirmation dialog, cascade deletion for subtasks, and dependency cleanup, with a basic undo functionality.
# Details:
Implement the TaskDeleteDialog using shadcn/ui Dialog. This dialog should include a confirmation step before deletion and a warning for cascade operations. Integrate the frontend with the DELETE /api/v1/tasks/{id} endpoint. On the backend, implement the logic for cascade deletion of subtasks and cleanup of dependencies when a task is removed. Consider a time-limited recovery/undo functionality for accidental deletions, potentially by soft-deleting tasks and having a background process for permanent deletion.

# Test Strategy:
1. **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for the backend cascade deletion logic and dependency cleanup. 2. **Integration Tests:** Test the integration between the frontend dialog and the backend API endpoint. 3. **UI Tests:** Verify the display and functionality of the confirmation dialog and cascade warning. 4. **Scenario Testing:** a. Delete a task with no subtasks or dependencies. b. Delete a task with subtasks, verifying cascade deletion. c. Delete a task with dependencies, verifying dependency cleanup. d. Test the undo functionality within the specified time limit. e. Attempt to delete a task without confirmation to ensure the dialog prevents it. 5. **Performance Testing:** Assess the performance of cascade deletions for tasks with a large number of subtasks/dependencies.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Confirmation Dialog UI/UX [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design the visual layout, interaction flow, and messaging for the task deletion confirmation dialog on the frontend.
### Details:
This includes wireframes, mockups, and defining the user experience for confirming task deletion, including warnings about cascade deletion.

## 2. Implement Frontend Confirmation Dialog [pending]
### Dependencies: 90.1
### Description: Develop the frontend code for the task deletion confirmation dialog based on the approved UI/UX design.
### Details:
Implement the dialog using the chosen frontend framework (e.g., React, Vue, Angular), including state management for showing/hiding and handling user input (confirm/cancel).

## 3. Design Backend API for Task Deletion [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the API endpoint, request/response structure, and authentication/authorization requirements for the task deletion operation.
### Details:
Specify the HTTP method, URL path, expected parameters (e.g., task ID), and potential error responses. Consider idempotency.

## 4. Implement Backend Cascade Deletion Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 90.3
### Description: Develop the backend logic to perform cascade deletion of related entities (e.g., subtasks, comments) when a parent task is deleted.
### Details:
Implement database queries or ORM operations to identify and delete all dependent records. Ensure transactional integrity to prevent partial deletions.

## 5. Implement Backend Dependency Cleanup [pending]
### Dependencies: 90.4
### Description: Develop the backend logic to clean up any remaining dependencies or references that are not directly deleted but become invalid (e.g., orphaned foreign keys, cached data).
### Details:
Identify and nullify or remove references in other tables that pointed to the deleted task. Consider cache invalidation strategies.

## 6. Design and Implement Time-Limited Undo Functionality (Backend) [pending]
### Dependencies: 90.4, 90.5
### Description: Design the backend mechanism for soft-deleting tasks and allowing them to be restored within a specific time window.
### Details:
This involves adding a 'deleted_at' timestamp or a 'status' field to the task, implementing a background process for permanent deletion after the undo window, and an API endpoint for undoing deletion.

## 7. Implement Time-Limited Undo Functionality (Frontend) [pending]
### Dependencies: 90.2, 90.6
### Description: Develop the frontend UI and logic to display the undo option after a task deletion and trigger the undo API call.
### Details:
This includes a temporary notification or banner with an 'Undo' button, a countdown timer for the undo window, and handling the UI state after an undo operation.
