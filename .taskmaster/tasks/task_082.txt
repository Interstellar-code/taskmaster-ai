# Description: Optimize the build process for the React application and Node.js server, and create production deployment scripts.
# Details:
For the React frontend, ensure Vite is configured for optimal production builds (e.g., minification, tree-shaking). For the Node.js backend, ensure `package.json` includes a `start` script that runs the compiled JavaScript (e.g., `node dist/server.js`). Create a comprehensive `build` script that builds both frontend and backend sequentially.

# Test Strategy:
Run the production `build` script. Verify that optimized static files are generated for the frontend and compiled JavaScript for the backend. Serve the built application locally (e.g., using `serve` for static files and `node dist/server.js` for backend) and verify all functionalities work as expected in a production-like environment.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Configure Vite Build Optimization and Code Splitting [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Optimize the build process by configuring Vite for code splitting and other performance enhancements.
### Details:
Review the current Vite configuration and implement code splitting and other optimizations to improve build performance and application load times.

## 2. Set Up Production Environment Variables and Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: 82.1
### Description: Establish a robust configuration for production environment variables to ensure smooth deployment.
### Details:
Define and document all necessary environment variables for production. Ensure that sensitive information is handled securely and that the configuration aligns with the PRD requirements.

## 3. Create Deployment Scripts and CI/CD Pipeline Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 82.1, 82.2
### Description: Develop deployment scripts and set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated production deployments.
### Details:
Write scripts to automate the deployment process and configure a CI/CD pipeline to streamline production deployments. Ensure the pipeline includes steps for building, testing, and deploying the application.
