# Description: Create an Express.js API server with a basic routing structure to handle incoming requests.
# Details:
Initialize a new Node.js project for the backend. Install `express` and `cors`. Create `server.js` (or `app.ts` if using TypeScript for backend) and set up a basic Express app. Define a root route (e.g., `/`) to return a simple JSON response to confirm the server is running. Implement CORS middleware to allow frontend requests.

# Test Strategy:
Start the Express server and use a tool like Postman or `curl` to send a GET request to the root endpoint. Verify that the server responds with the expected JSON message and that CORS headers are correctly set.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up Express.js Project Structure and Dependencies [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize a new Express.js project and set up the necessary project structure and dependencies.
### Details:
Create a new directory for the project, initialize it with npm, and install Express.js along with any other necessary dependencies such as dotenv for environment variables.

## 2. Create Basic Server Configuration with CORS and Middleware [pending]
### Dependencies: 62.1
### Description: Configure the Express.js server with basic settings, including CORS and middleware.
### Details:
Set up the server to use middleware for JSON parsing, logging, and CORS to handle cross-origin requests. Ensure the server can read environment variables for configuration.

## 3. Implement Initial API Routes and Error Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 62.2
### Description: Develop initial API routes and implement basic error handling mechanisms.
### Details:
Create a few basic API routes to handle requests and responses. Implement error handling middleware to catch and respond to errors gracefully.
