# Description: Implement functionality to generate traceability reports, linking tasks back to their source PRDs. This is essential for audit and compliance requirements.
# Details:
Develop the `task-master prd-traceability-report --format=csv` command. This command should generate a report (e.g., CSV, JSON) that clearly maps tasks to their originating PRD files and relevant metadata. The report should include task ID, title, PRD file path, parsed date, and potentially other relevant PRD source fields. Ensure the report format is suitable for compliance auditing.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for the report generation logic, verifying that the output format is correct and contains all required data. Manual review of generated reports to ensure accuracy and completeness of traceability information.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define `prd-traceability-report` Command Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design the command-line interface for `prd-traceability-report`, including arguments for output format (e.g., --format csv, --format json) and potential filtering options.
### Details:
Specify command name, required and optional arguments, and help text. Consider using a library like `argparse`.

## 2. Identify Required Data Points for Report [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: List all necessary data points to be included in the traceability report, such as task ID, title, PRD file path, parsed date, associated requirements, and linked code changes.
### Details:
Brainstorm all relevant information that would contribute to PRD traceability. Consider data available from existing parsing and linking processes.

## 3. Implement Report Generation Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 27.1, 27.2
### Description: Develop the core logic to gather data points identified in Subtask 2, process them, and format them according to the specified output format (CSV, JSON).
### Details:
This involves querying the internal data structures (e.g., parsed PRD data, linked code changes) and preparing them for output. Create separate functions for CSV and JSON formatting.

## 4. Develop Unit Tests for Output Format [done]
### Dependencies: 27.3
### Description: Write unit tests to verify that the `prd-traceability-report` command generates output in the correct format (CSV and JSON) based on the `--format` argument.
### Details:
Tests should check for correct delimiters, JSON structure, header rows, and data types for each format.

## 5. Develop Unit Tests for Data Accuracy [done]
### Dependencies: 27.3
### Description: Create unit tests to ensure the data points included in the report are accurate and complete, matching the expected values from the source data.
### Details:
Tests should verify that task IDs, titles, file paths, parsed dates, and linked information are correctly extracted and presented in the report.

## 6. Outline Manual Review Steps for Report [done]
### Dependencies: 27.4, 27.5
### Description: Define a set of manual review steps to validate the generated traceability report for overall correctness, readability, and completeness beyond automated tests.
### Details:
This includes spot-checking data, verifying links, and ensuring the report meets compliance or auditing requirements. Consider scenarios like missing data or incorrect associations.
