# Description: Refine the user interface and user experience of the PRD upload feature based on testing feedback. This includes ensuring consistent styling, clear feedback, and addressing any identified usability issues.
# Details:
1. **Styling Consistency**: Ensure the 'Upload PRD' button and the `PRDUploadModal` adhere to the `shadcn/ui` design system and the overall TaskHero Kanban app's visual style.
2. **Clear Feedback**: Review and enhance all user feedback mechanisms:
   - Loading indicators during file processing.
   - Success and error messages (toast notifications) are clear, concise, and actionable.
   - Validation messages for file input are prominent and user-friendly.
3. **Drag-and-Drop Area**: Refine the visual design of the drag-and-drop area for clarity and intuitiveness (e.g., dashed border, appropriate icons, state changes on hover/drag-over).
4. **Accessibility**: Conduct a thorough accessibility review:
   - Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard navigable.
   - Add or refine ARIA labels for screen readers (e.g., for the upload button, modal title, file input).
   - Check color contrast ratios for text and UI elements.
5. **Responsiveness**: Verify the modal and button display correctly on various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
6. **Edge Case UI**: Ensure the UI gracefully handles edge cases like very long file names, multiple validation errors, or network disconnections.

# Test Strategy:
1. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Conduct UAT with a small group of target users to gather feedback on usability and identify any remaining pain points.
2. **Visual Regression Testing**: Use tools to compare UI components against baseline images to catch unintended visual changes.
3. **Accessibility Audit**: Utilize accessibility testing tools (e.g., Lighthouse, axe DevTools) to identify and fix WCAG compliance issues.
4. **Cross-Browser/Device Testing**: Re-verify the UI/UX across different browsers and devices to ensure consistent experience.
