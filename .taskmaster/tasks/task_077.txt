# Description: Create API endpoints for updating all properties of a specific task.
# Details:
Implement a PUT endpoint at `/api/v1/tasks/:id`. This endpoint should accept a JSON payload containing all editable task properties. Use the TaskMaster core integration to update the task in `tasks.json`. Ensure robust validation for all incoming fields and handle potential errors during file write operations.

# Test Strategy:
Use Postman or `curl` to send PUT requests with various task updates (e.g., changing title, description, priority). Verify that `tasks.json` is updated correctly and that the API returns the updated task or a success message. Test with invalid data to ensure validation works.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create PUT/PATCH Endpoints for Task Content Updates [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop API endpoints to handle updates to task content, allowing users to modify task details using PUT or PATCH requests.
### Details:
Design and implement the necessary API routes and handlers to support task content updates. Ensure the endpoints are RESTful and adhere to the application's existing API structure.

## 2. Implement Validation for Task Data and Rich Text Content [pending]
### Dependencies: 77.1
### Description: Ensure that all task data, including rich text content, is validated before being processed by the API.
### Details:
Develop validation logic to check for data integrity and compliance with the application's data model. This includes validating text formatting, length, and any other constraints defined in the PRD.

## 3. Add Versioning and Conflict Resolution for Concurrent Updates [pending]
### Dependencies: 77.1, 77.2
### Description: Implement a system to handle versioning of task updates and resolve conflicts when multiple updates occur simultaneously.
### Details:
Design a mechanism to track changes to tasks and manage version history. Implement conflict resolution strategies to ensure data consistency and integrity when concurrent updates are detected.
