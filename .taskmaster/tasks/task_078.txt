# Description: Implement form validation and error handling for task updates within the modal.
# Details:
Add client-side validation to the `TaskModal` form before submitting updates to the API. For example, ensure the title is not empty. Display clear error messages to the user if validation fails. Implement error handling for API responses, showing user-friendly messages for network errors or backend validation failures.

# Test Strategy:
Attempt to save a task with invalid data (e.g., empty title). Verify that client-side validation prevents submission and displays an error. Simulate an API error (e.g., by temporarily disabling the backend) and verify that the frontend handles it gracefully and informs the user.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Form Validation Schemas and Rules [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the validation schemas and rules for the TaskModal form to ensure data integrity before submission.
### Details:
Use a library like Yup to define validation schemas for the form fields. Ensure that the title field is required and not empty. Define additional rules as necessary based on the form's requirements.

## 2. Implement Real-Time Validation Feedback [pending]
### Dependencies: 78.1
### Description: Add real-time validation feedback to the TaskModal form to provide immediate user feedback on input errors.
### Details:
Integrate the validation schemas with the form using a library like Formik. Display error messages next to the form fields as the user types, updating in real-time based on the validation results.

## 3. Add Error Boundary Components for Error Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement error boundary components to catch and handle errors gracefully within the TaskModal component.
### Details:
Create a React error boundary component that wraps the TaskModal. Ensure it catches any rendering errors and displays a fallback UI to the user.

## 4. Create User-Friendly Error Messages and Recovery Options [pending]
### Dependencies: 78.1, 78.2, 78.3
### Description: Develop user-friendly error messages and provide recovery options for both client-side validation errors and API response errors.
### Details:
Design clear and concise error messages for validation errors. For API errors, display messages that explain the issue and suggest possible recovery actions, such as retrying the operation.
