# Description: Implement responsive design principles to ensure the Kanban board and task details are usable on mobile and tablet devices.
# Details:
Utilize Tailwind CSS responsive utilities (e.g., `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) to adjust column layouts, font sizes, and component spacing for different screen sizes. For smaller screens, consider stacking Kanban columns vertically or implementing a horizontal scroll. Ensure the `TaskModal` is fully responsive and readable on mobile.

# Test Strategy:
Use browser developer tools to simulate various mobile and tablet screen sizes. Verify that the Kanban board layout adapts gracefully, tasks are readable, and the drag-and-drop functionality remains usable. Ensure the task detail modal is fully functional and well-formatted on small screens.
