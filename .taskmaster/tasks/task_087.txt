# Task ID: 87
# Title: Develop Reusable Frontend Form Components
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 86
# Priority: high
# PRD Source: None (manually created)
# Description: Create a library of reusable React form components using shadcn/ui for various task properties, focusing on generic, re-usable components that can be composed to build complex forms with client-side validation logic.
# Details:
Implement shadcn/ui components such as Dialog, Form, Input, Textarea, Select, Button, Checkbox, Popover, Command, Badge, Alert, Toast, Calendar, DatePicker, DropdownMenu, and ContextMenu. Each component should be designed for reusability and configurability, allowing for easy integration into different forms. Incorporate client-side validation using a suitable library (e.g., Zod with React Hook Form) to provide immediate user feedback. Develop a clear component API for each, including props for labels, placeholders, validation rules, and event handlers. Create a storybook or similar documentation for each component demonstrating its usage and variations. Ensure accessibility standards are met for all components.

# Test Strategy:
Develop comprehensive unit tests for each reusable component to verify its rendering, props handling, and event emissions. Create integration tests to ensure components compose correctly and client-side validation functions as expected. Manually test each component in a sample form to verify UI/UX, responsiveness, and accessibility across different browsers and devices. Verify that validation messages are displayed correctly and prevent form submission when invalid.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Setup Project and Core Form Infrastructure [in-progress]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize the React project, integrate shadcn/ui, and set up the core infrastructure for form handling using React Hook Form and Zod for validation. This includes configuring the Form component from shadcn/ui to work seamlessly with React Hook Form.
### Details:
1. Create a new React project (e.g., with Vite or Next.js). 2. Install and configure shadcn/ui following its official documentation. 3. Install `react-hook-form` and `zod`. 4. Create a base `Form` component (e.g., `components/ui/form.tsx`) that wraps `shadcn/ui`'s Form and integrates with `react-hook-form`'s `useForm` context. 5. Implement a basic example form to verify the setup.

## 2. Develop Basic Input and Selection Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 87.1
### Description: Implement reusable `Input`, `Textarea`, `Select`, and `Checkbox` components using shadcn/ui, integrated with React Hook Form and Zod validation. Each component should expose a clear API for labels, placeholders, validation rules, and error messages.
### Details:
1. Create `FormField` wrapper components (e.g., `components/form-fields/FormField.tsx`) that handle displaying labels, error messages, and connecting to `react-hook-form`'s `Controller` or `useFormContext`. 2. Develop `Input` (for text, number, email, etc.), `Textarea`, `Select`, and `Checkbox` components. 3. Ensure each component accepts `name`, `label`, `placeholder`, `description`, and `rules` (for Zod schema definition) props. 4. Implement client-side validation feedback using Zod schemas passed via `react-hook-form`.

## 3. Implement Date Picker and Advanced Selection Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 87.1, 87.2
### Description: Develop reusable `DatePicker` (using `Calendar` and `Popover`), `DropdownMenu`, and `Command` (for search/select) components, integrated with React Hook Form and Zod validation.
### Details:
1. Create a `DatePicker` component that combines `shadcn/ui`'s `Calendar` and `Popover` components, allowing date selection. Integrate it with `react-hook-form`. 2. Develop a reusable `DropdownMenu` component that can be used for various selection or action scenarios within forms. 3. Implement a `Command` component (e.g., for a searchable select/combobox) that integrates with `react-hook-form` for value selection.

## 4. Develop Action and Display Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 87.1
### Description: Implement reusable `Button`, `Badge`, `Alert`, and `Toast` components using shadcn/ui. Focus on their reusability and configurability for various states and purposes within a form context (e.g., submit buttons, status indicators, notifications).
### Details:
1. Create a generic `Button` component with props for `variant`, `size`, `loading` state, and `onClick` handlers. 2. Develop a `Badge` component for displaying small, contextual information (e.g., status). 3. Implement an `Alert` component for displaying important messages within the form. 4. Set up a `Toast` notification system for global feedback (e.g., form submission success/failure).

## 5. Develop Dialog and Context Menu Components, and Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 87.1, 87.2, 87.3, 87.4
### Description: Implement reusable `Dialog` and `ContextMenu` components using shadcn/ui. Create comprehensive Storybook documentation for all developed components, demonstrating their usage, props, and variations. Ensure accessibility standards are met.
### Details:
1. Develop a generic `Dialog` component for modal forms or confirmations, ensuring it can be easily triggered and controlled. 2. Implement a `ContextMenu` component for right-click interactions within forms or data displays. 3. Create a Storybook instance and add detailed stories for all previously developed components (`Input`, `Select`, `DatePicker`, `Button`, `Dialog`, etc.). 4. Document each component's API, usage examples, and accessibility considerations. 5. Conduct a final accessibility audit for all components.
