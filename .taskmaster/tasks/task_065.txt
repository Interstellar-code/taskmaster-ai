# Description: Configure the development environment for both frontend and backend with hot reload and build scripts.
# Details:
For the frontend, Vite provides hot module replacement (HMR) out-of-the-box. For the backend, use `nodemon` or `ts-node-dev` to enable hot reloading of the Express server. Configure `package.json` scripts for `dev` (running both frontend and backend concurrently, e.g., using `concurrently`) and `build` (for production builds of both).

# Test Strategy:
Run the combined `dev` script. Make a change in a React component and verify the browser updates without a full refresh. Make a change in an Express route and verify the server restarts automatically. Run the `build` script and ensure production-ready bundles are generated for both frontend and backend.

# Subtasks:
