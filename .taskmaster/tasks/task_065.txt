# Description: Review and verify the existing development environment configuration for both frontend and backend with hot reload and build scripts.
# Details:
The development environment is already configured and functional. The Kanban-webapp uses Vite with hot module replacement (HMR) and has proper development scripts and build configuration. No additional setup is needed, but ensure everything is working as expected.

# Test Strategy:
Run the existing `dev` script to verify that the development environment is functioning correctly. Make a change in a React component and ensure the browser updates without a full refresh. Make a change in an Express route and confirm the server restarts automatically. Run the `build` script to ensure production-ready bundles are generated for both frontend and backend.

# Subtasks:
