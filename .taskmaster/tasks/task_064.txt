# Description: The GET /api/v1/tasks endpoint has been fully implemented in the MCP API routes file, providing comprehensive task data retrieval and CRUD operations. This implementation was completed via Task 85, ensuring the endpoint includes all necessary functionality.
# Details:
The endpoint is located in kanban-webapp/server/routes/mcp-api-routes.js and includes full task data retrieval, parsing, formatting, error handling, and response validation. This implementation integrates with TaskMaster core functions and exceeds the original requirements by supporting complete CRUD operations. The completion of Task 85 has ensured that all functionalities are in place.

# Test Strategy:
Use Postman or `curl` to send a GET request to `/api/v1/tasks`. Verify that the API returns a JSON array of tasks, matching the expected data structure. Test CRUD operations to ensure full functionality and robust error handling. Confirm that all functionalities are working as expected post Task 85 completion.
