# Description: Integrate the `PRDUploadModal` into the `EnhancedKanbanBoard.tsx` component. This involves adding a new 'Upload PRD' button, handling its click event to open the modal, and implementing callbacks for successful uploads to refresh the PRD list and display toast notifications.
# Details:
1. **Update `EnhancedKanbanBoard.tsx`**: Open `kanban-app/EnhancedKanbanBoard.tsx`.
2. **Add Upload Button**: Place a new button next to the existing 'Create Task' button in the filter controls. This button should:
   - Have an 'Upload' icon from `lucide-react`.
   - Display the text 'Upload PRD'.
   - Be styled consistently with existing buttons (secondary button style).
3. **Import and Integrate `PRDUploadModal`**: Import the `PRDUploadModal` component and integrate it into `EnhancedKanbanBoard.tsx`.
4. **Handle Button Click**: Implement an event handler for the 'Upload PRD' button to open the `PRDUploadModal`.
5. **Success Callback**: Implement a callback function to be executed upon successful PRD upload from the modal. This callback should:
   - Trigger a refresh of the PRD list displayed in the PRD filter dropdown.
   - Display a success toast notification with relevant PRD details.
6. **Error Callback**: Implement an error callback to display an error toast notification if the upload fails.

# Test Strategy:
1. **UI Integration Tests**: Verify the 'Upload PRD' button appears correctly next to 'Create Task'.
2. **Workflow Tests**: Click the 'Upload PRD' button and ensure the `PRDUploadModal` opens.
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Perform a full upload flow:
   - Upload a valid MD/TXT file.
   - Verify the success toast notification appears.
   - Confirm the modal closes automatically.
   - Check that the newly uploaded PRD immediately appears in the PRD filter dropdown.
   - Test with an invalid file to ensure an error toast notification is displayed and the modal handles the error gracefully.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Prepare `EnhancedKanbanBoard.tsx` for PRD Upload Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the `EnhancedKanbanBoard.tsx` component by importing necessary components and hooks for modal management and state. This includes importing `PRDUploadModal` and potentially `useState` for modal visibility.
### Details:
Locate `kanban-app/EnhancedKanbanBoard.tsx`. Add `import { PRDUploadModal } from './PRDUploadModal';` (adjust path as needed) and `import React, { useState } from 'react';` if not already present. Initialize a state variable for modal visibility, e.g., `const [isUploadModalOpen, setIsUploadModalOpen] = useState(false);`.

## 2. Add 'Upload PRD' Button to Kanban Board [pending]
### Dependencies: 95.1
### Description: Implement the 'Upload PRD' button in the `EnhancedKanbanBoard.tsx` component, placing it next to the existing 'Create Task' button within the filter controls section.
### Details:
Find the section containing the 'Create Task' button. Add a new button component (e.g., `<Button>`) next to it. The button should have an 'Upload' icon from `lucide-react` (e.g., `<Upload className='mr-2 h-4 w-4' />`), display the text 'Upload PRD', and be styled consistently with existing buttons (e.g., `variant='secondary'`). Add an `onClick` handler that will open the modal.

## 3. Implement Modal Open/Close Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 95.2
### Description: Connect the 'Upload PRD' button's click event to open the `PRDUploadModal` and implement the logic to close the modal.
### Details:
In the `onClick` handler for the 'Upload PRD' button, set `setIsUploadModalOpen(true);`. Render the `PRDUploadModal` component conditionally based on `isUploadModalOpen`. Pass a prop to the modal (e.g., `onClose={() => setIsUploadModalOpen(false)}`) to allow it to close itself.

## 4. Define PRD Upload Success Callback [pending]
### Dependencies: 95.3
### Description: Create a callback function within `EnhancedKanbanBoard.tsx` that will be executed upon a successful PRD upload from the `PRDUploadModal`. This function will handle toast notifications.
### Details:
Define a function, e.g., `handleUploadSuccess = (prdDetails) => { ... };`. Inside this function, use a toast notification library (e.g., `react-hot-toast` or a custom `useToast` hook) to display a success message like 'PRD uploaded successfully: [PRD Name]'. Include relevant `prdDetails` in the toast.

## 5. Define PRD Upload Error Callback [pending]
### Dependencies: 95.4
### Description: Create a callback function within `EnhancedKanbanBoard.tsx` that will be executed if a PRD upload fails in the `PRDUploadModal`. This function will handle error toast notifications.
### Details:
Define a function, e.g., `handleUploadError = (error) => { ... };`. Inside this function, use the toast notification library to display an error message like 'PRD upload failed: [Error Message]'.

## 6. Integrate Callbacks with `PRDUploadModal` [pending]
### Dependencies: 95.5
### Description: Pass the defined success and error callback functions to the `PRDUploadModal` component as props.
### Details:
When rendering `PRDUploadModal`, add `onSuccess={handleUploadSuccess}` and `onError={handleUploadError}` props. Ensure `PRDUploadModal` is designed to accept and call these props internally upon completion of its upload logic.

## 7. Implement PRD List Refresh Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 95.6
### Description: Add logic within the `handleUploadSuccess` callback to trigger a refresh of the PRD list displayed in the PRD filter dropdown.
### Details:
Identify the mechanism used to fetch and display the PRD list in the filter dropdown. This might involve calling a data fetching function, invalidating a cache (e.g., using `react-query`'s `queryClient.invalidateQueries`), or updating a state variable that triggers a re-fetch. Implement this refresh logic inside `handleUploadSuccess`.

## 8. Refine UI/UX and Edge Cases [pending]
### Dependencies: 95.7
### Description: Review the integration for any UI/UX inconsistencies, ensure proper loading states, and handle potential edge cases like network issues or empty PRD lists gracefully.
### Details:
Check button disabled states during upload, modal loading indicators, and ensure toast messages are clear and informative. Consider what happens if the PRD list refresh fails. Ensure accessibility considerations are met.

## 9. Code Review and Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 95.8
### Description: Conduct a thorough code review of all changes, ensure code quality, and update any relevant documentation.
### Details:
Review `EnhancedKanbanBoard.tsx` and any other modified files for adherence to coding standards, clarity, and maintainability. Add comments where necessary. Update any internal documentation or README files if the new feature impacts setup or usage.
