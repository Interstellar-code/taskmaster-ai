Executive Summary

Enhance TaskMaster AI to track and display the source PRD (Product Requirements Document) file for all tasks generated from PRD parsing. This feature will provide complete traceability from tasks back to their original requirements, improving project management, compliance, and debugging capabilities.

Problem Statement

Current State
- Tasks generated from PRD files have no reference to their source document
- Users cannot trace tasks back to original requirements
- No visibility into which PRD generated specific tasks
- Difficult to update tasks when PRD changes
- No audit trail for requirement traceability

Pain Points
1. Traceability Gap: No way to identify which PRD generated specific tasks
2. Change Management: When PRDs are updated, no clear way to identify affected tasks
3. Compliance Issues: Lack of audit trail for requirement-to-task mapping
4. Debugging Difficulty: Hard to troubleshoot task generation issues
5. Documentation Disconnect: Tasks exist in isolation from their source requirements

Proposed Solution

PRD Source Tracking System Overview
Implement comprehensive PRD source tracking that:

1. Records PRD file path and metadata during task generation
2. Displays PRD source information in all task views and reports
3. Provides commands to query tasks by PRD source
4. Maintains historical tracking of PRD changes
5. Enables bulk operations on tasks from specific PRDs

Technical Requirements

Core Implementation
1. Task Schema Enhancement: Add PRD source fields to task data structure
2. Parse Command Integration: Capture PRD metadata during task generation
3. Display Integration: Show PRD source in all task views and reports
4. Query Commands: Add commands to filter and search by PRD source
5. Historical Tracking: Maintain version history of PRD associations

Data Structure Changes

- Ensure backward compatibility with older task formats

Error Handling Scenarios
- PRD file not found or moved
- Corrupted PRD metadata
- File permission issues
- Invalid file paths or formats
- Network drive accessibility

Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading of PRD metadata for large projects
- Efficient file hash calculation
- Optimized queries for PRD-based filtering
- Minimal impact on existing command performance

Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for PRD metadata capture and storage
- Integration tests for display enhancements
- End-to-end tests for complete workflow
- Performance tests with large task sets
- Cross-platform compatibility tests

Conclusion

PRD source tracking will provide essential traceability capabilities to TaskMaster AI, enabling users to maintain clear connections between requirements and implementation tasks. This enhancement supports better project management, compliance requirements, and change management workflows while maintaining the tool's ease of use and performance.

The implementation follows TaskMaster's established patterns, ensures backward compatibility, and provides a foundation for advanced requirement management features. Success will be measured through improved traceability, user satisfaction, and compliance capabilities.
