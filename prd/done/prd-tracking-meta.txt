## Executive Summary

This PRD defines the implementation of a comprehensive PRD lifecycle tracking and management system for TaskMaster AI. The system will provide automated PRD status management based on linked task completion, following TaskMaster's established patterns for JSON-based metadata storage, file organization, and CLI command structure. This enhancement will transform TaskMaster from a task-only management tool into a complete project lifecycle management system.

## Problem Statement

Currently, TaskMaster AI lacks systematic PRD management capabilities:
- PRD files are scattered across directories without organization or status tracking
- No automated tracking of PRD completion status based on linked task progress
- Missing centralized metadata management for PRD files and their relationships
- No integration between PRD lifecycle and task management workflows
- AI agents lack comprehensive guidelines for PRD organization and maintenance
- Users cannot easily track project progress at the PRD level
- No historical tracking of PRD changes and evolution over time

## Solution Overview

Implement a comprehensive PRD lifecycle management system that:
1. Organizes PRDs in status-based directory structure (`/prd/pending`, `/prd/in-progress`, `/prd/done`)
2. Maintains detailed metadata in centralized `prds.json` file with bidirectional task linking
3. Automatically updates PRD status based on linked task completion percentages
4. Provides comprehensive CLI commands for PRD management and reporting
5. Integrates seamlessly with existing TaskMaster features (Kanban board, interactive menu)
6. Updates AI agent guidelines for automated PRD organization and maintenance
7. Includes migration system for existing PRDs with zero data loss

## Detailed Requirements

### 1. Directory Structure & File Organization

#### 1.1 Core Directory Structure
Create organized `/prd/` directory with status-based organization:
```
/prd/
â”œâ”€â”€ pending/           # New or not-yet-started PRDs
â”œâ”€â”€ in-progress/       # PRDs with active tasks
â”œâ”€â”€ done/             # Completed PRDs (100% task completion)
â”œâ”€â”€ archived/         # Archived/historical PRDs
â”œâ”€â”€ templates/        # PRD templates for consistent creation
â””â”€â”€ prds.json         # Central metadata file
```

#### 1.2 Automated File Movement
- PRDs automatically move between status folders based on linked task completion
- Original filenames preserved across all moves
- Atomic file operations to prevent data loss
- Backup creation before any file movement operations

#### 1.3 Version Control & History
- Maintain PRD version snapshots in `/prd/archived/versions/`
- Track all modifications with timestamps and change descriptions
- Provide rollback capability to restore previous PRD versions

### 2. PRD Metadata Schema

#### 2.1 Central Metadata File (`prds.json`)
Comprehensive metadata structure tracking all PRD information:
```json
{
  "prds": [
    {
      "id": "prd-tracking-meta-20250106",
      "title": "PRD Lifecycle Tracking System",
      "fileName": "prd-tracking-meta.txt",
      "status": "pending",
      "complexity": "high",
      "createdDate": "2025-01-06T16:00:00.000Z",
      "lastModified": "2025-01-06T16:00:00.000Z",
      "filePath": "prd/pending/prd-tracking-meta.txt",
      "fileHash": "sha256-calculated-hash",
      "fileSize": 15420,
      "description": "Comprehensive PRD lifecycle management system",
      "tags": ["core-feature", "automation", "metadata"],
      "linkedTaskIds": [],
      "taskStats": {
        "totalTasks": 0,
        "completedTasks": 0,
        "pendingTasks": 0,
        "inProgressTasks": 0,
        "completionPercentage": 0
      },
      "estimatedEffort": "50 hours",
      "priority": "high"
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "lastUpdated": "2025-01-06T16:00:00.000Z",
    "totalPrds": 1
  }
}
```

### 3. Automated Status Management System

#### 3.1 Task-to-PRD Linking Enhancement
Enhance existing task structure to include comprehensive PRD references:
```javascript
// Enhanced task.prdSource structure
{
  "prdId": "prd-tracking-meta-20250106",
  "fileName": "prd-tracking-meta.txt", 
  "filePath": "prd/pending/prd-tracking-meta.txt",
  "fileHash": "sha256-hash",
  "parsedDate": "2025-01-06T16:00:00.000Z"
}
```

#### 3.2 Automatic Status Transition Rules
- **Pending â†’ In-Progress**: When first linked task changes to 'in-progress'
- **In-Progress â†’ Done**: When ALL linked tasks reach 'done' status (100% completion)
- **Manual Override**: Allow manual status changes with validation and audit trail
- **Rollback Protection**: Prevent status regression without explicit user confirmation

### 4. CLI Command Extensions

#### 4.1 PRD List Command
```bash
task-master prd list [--status pending|in-progress|done] [--format table|json]
```

#### 4.2 PRD Status Management
```bash
task-master prd status --id <prd-id> --status <new-status> [--force]
```

#### 4.3 PRD Details and Reporting
```bash
task-master prd show --id <prd-id> [--include-tasks] [--include-history]
```

#### 4.4 PRD Synchronization
```bash
task-master prd sync [--id <prd-id>] [--force]
```

#### 4.5 PRD Migration System
```bash
task-master prd migrate [--dry-run] [--source <path>] [--backup]
```

### 5. Integration with Existing Features

#### 5.1 Kanban Board Enhancement
Add PRD filtering options to existing Kanban board:
- "View All Tasks" (current behavior)
- "View Tasks by PRD" (filter by specific PRD)
- "View Tasks by PRD Status" (show tasks from pending/in-progress/done PRDs)

#### 5.2 Interactive Menu Integration
Add new "ðŸ“„ PRD Management" section to main menu with:
- List PRDs with status overview
- Show PRD details and linked task progress
- Update PRD status manually
- Sync PRD status with task completion
- Archive completed PRDs

### 6. AI Agent Integration

#### 6.1 Enhanced Guidelines
Update `.augment-guidelines`, `.cursor/rules/`, and `.roo/` rules to include:
- PRD organization patterns and file management rules
- Automated status tracking based on task completion
- Bidirectional task-to-PRD reference maintenance
- PRD creation and template usage guidelines

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Directory Organization**: All PRDs organized in status-based `/prd/` structure
2. **Metadata Management**: Complete `prds.json` tracking all PRD information
3. **Automatic Status Updates**: PRD status automatically updates based on task completion
4. **CLI Commands**: All specified CLI commands functional and tested
5. **Integration**: Seamless integration with Kanban board and interactive menu
6. **Migration**: Successful migration of existing PRDs without data loss
7. **AI Agent Rules**: Updated guidelines for all supported AI editors
8. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing task management functionality unchanged
