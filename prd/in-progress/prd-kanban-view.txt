**Project Name:** PRD Kanban Board View for TaskMaster AI
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-06-01
**Author(s):** Development Team
**Stakeholders:** TaskMaster Users, PRD Managers, Development Team, Project Managers

## 📋 Executive Summary

**Problem Statement:**
TaskMaster AI has successfully implemented a task Kanban board view, but lacks a dedicated visual interface for PRD lifecycle management. Users managing multiple PRDs must rely on CLI commands and text-based lists to understand PRD status distribution, track PRD progress through lifecycle stages, and manage PRD workflow transitions. This creates inefficiency when overseeing multiple PRDs and their associated task relationships.

**Solution Overview:**
Implement a terminal-based Kanban board view specifically for PRD management within TaskMaster's existing CLI interface. The PRD Kanban board will display PRDs as visual cards organized by lifecycle status columns (pending, in-progress, done, archived), support keyboard navigation for status updates, and integrate seamlessly with the existing PRD tracking system and Project Management menu.

**Business Impact:**
- Enhanced PRD lifecycle visibility with terminal-based visual management
- Faster PRD status assessment and workflow management within CLI environment
- Improved PRD oversight capabilities for project managers and development teams
- Better understanding of PRD-to-task relationships and completion tracking
- Consistent user experience leveraging existing task Kanban patterns

**Success Metrics:**
- PRD Kanban board successfully displays all PRDs organized by 4 status columns (pending, in-progress, done, archived)
- Keyboard navigation enables efficient PRD status transitions and metadata viewing
- PRD cards display comprehensive metadata including linked task counts and completion percentages
- Integration with Project Management submenu provides seamless access
- PRD status updates automatically sync with existing prd/prds.json tracking system
