# Test Enhanced Description

This is a comprehensive test document to verify that the enhanced description extraction works correctly during PRD upload. The system should automatically extract this paragraph as the description without needing manual analysis or AI processing.

## Technical Requirements

The system needs to handle multiple scenarios:
- Structured documents with clear headings
- Unstructured content that relies on first paragraph extraction
- Mixed format documents

## Implementation Details

Key features to implement include automated description extraction, improved metadata parsing, and fallback mechanisms for various content formats.
